    "content": "Puhak!\nBlood splattered everywhere. A woman’s dazed gaze fell on the spear impaling her left chest. When she felt the coldness of the blade penetrating her heart, her pupils shook as her body slowly lost strength.\nAs the woman collapsed to the ground, an owner of an anguished cry rushed to the spearman’s back. The spearman let go of his spear, startled by how quick the voice was approaching him. But that was it. The spearman quickly spun around, swinging his fist at the enemy behind his back.\nThe target fell backward from the impact. The spearman didn’t stop and swung down his bloody fist once more.\nPow!\nThe target’s head burst open in an instant. Even then, the spearman didn’t stop. Once, twice, thrice…. He roared and screamed, bashing the target’s head until he finally smashed the man’s skull and brain to pieces.\nOnly then did he stop his fists and looked around with a pair of bloodshot eyes. He picked up his spear. Then, he kicked off the ground, which was wet with a disgusting mixture of brain matter and human flesh.\nThe man resembling a demon shot into a swirling fog.\nA swirling fog of ashes….\n**\nCough. The collapsed woman heaved out a dry cough. She scowled from the smell of ash in the area. But her frown only lasted a moment. She lifted her head and surveyed her surroundings.\n“Is anybody there…?”\nOnly a bleak gust of wind blew by.\n“Is everyone… dead?”\nShe waited, but no reply came back. Kuk. She let off a sudden chuckle and began humming as if she was singing a lullaby.\n“Dead, dead, everyone’s dead….”\nShe looked at a burnt corpse near her and thought it looked better than some others. In another spot, a lump of meat that was once a human being floated in a pool of blood. She looked around once more as disappointment emerged in her expression.\nHer throat hurt.\nShe somehow managed to raise her upper body before spitting out her saliva. Her complexion lightened a little before she looked up at the distant sky with her blurring sight.\n‘How…’\n…How did she end up like this?\nOne day, an alien race appeared in her world. Although it was only discovered later on, this race had been chased away from its original home-world. After suffering a crushing defeat, they had wandered aimlessly in outer space for a very long time before invading her planet.\nIn order to become its new overlord.\n“Those retards.”\nThis woman was the princess of a certain kingdom subordinate to the Empire. She was six years old when she first heard the news of the alien race’s appearance, and she was ten when she heard the news of the Empire’s collapse.\nDespite being praised as the ‘Never Setting Sun’ for their overwhelming technology and magic engineering, the almighty Empire had fallen in less than four years.\nSoon, the alien race devoured the Chief Deity worshipped by the Empire, turning the land into an ownerless wilderness.\nThat was probably when everything began.\nDeprived of its Chief Deity, the planet fell prey to the many other races that had been eyeing it for an opportunity to pounce.\nThe first invading alien race posed its leader as the new Chief Deity and began a bloody invasion throughout the planet. It was around then that new alien races began to appear one by one.\nOne had appeared in the name of ‘survival’, and the others under the banner of ‘conquest’….\nRecalling the events of the past, the princess chuckled feebly. The land once ruled by mankind was now a war ground for several foreign races.\nPushed around this way, pushed around that way, the original inhabitants devolved to a candle flickering in the wind.\nBut accompanying the appearance of these foreign races were the seven un-worshipped gods, who were born together during the birth of the planet. These seven gods promised to help the surviving humans, and the inhabitants promised to worship them in return.\nAnd so, the deal was struck. But to the surprise of the inhabitants, help from these gods came in a strange manner.\nTheir method of fighting back was to form an army by summoning another race that most resembled the world’s inhabitants.\nThere was no other choice. Even the mighty Empire was toppled within a brief four years, so how could the kingdoms that served under it resist the alien races?\nFurthermore, the population had fallen drastically due to the war.\n“Those damned sons of bitches.”\nThe princess spat out a curse as she blankly stared up at the sky.\n‘We shouldn’t have trusted them in the first place.’\nIn truth, it wasn’t so bad in the beginning. The first Earthlings summoned to aid the inhabitants grew at a shocking speed under the gods’ divine protection.\nHowever, as their influence grew and gradually overwhelmed that of the original inhabitants, the situation began to change.\nThere really were all sorts of reasons. Some formed groups by nationality, some by the color of their skin, some by religion, and some by politics.\nIn the end, ‘profit’ was the problem. The factionalization among the Earthlings began to cause rifts in the relationship of the once-united kingdoms. The alliance formed under the desire to survive broke into pieces, and the ensuing internal conflict naturally weakened their forces.\nThere were some who even revolted against the new gods.\nIt was truly unfathomable.\nBut was that all?\nIn the end, the majority of Earthlings refused to participate in the final battle. They coldly ignored the inhabitants’ desperate pleas and returned to their home-world.\nThis was why rage boiled inside the princess.\n“Sons of….”\nShe was about to curse once more but quickly shut her mouth.\nSplash… splash….\nA soft sound echoed out amidst the gradually-cooling mountain of corpses. The sound approached her, but it stopped a bit to the right of her.\nStanding there was a burnt corpse.\n[Amazing.]\nIn front of the corpse was a large darkness that couldn’t be described with words.\n[Truly amazing! I did not place much hope, but to think you actually survived this bloody battle…]\n‘An Earthling?’\nAs if to answer the princess’ question, the collapsed man raised his head. A powerful emotion surged up within the princess’ heart, but she had no choice but to swallow it back down.\nThe state of the Earthling was horrific, so much so that she wanted to avert her gaze.\nThe number may have been extremely small, but it wasn’t as if no Earthlings participated in the battle. The state of the burnt man clearly demonstrated that he had fulfilled his duty in this battlefield.\nWhen the princess thought this far, she began to develop a sense of sympathy. At the same time, she felt it was a shame.\n‘If only all the other Earthlings were like him….’\n[I want to praise your achievements a bit more, but you do not have much time left.]\nA low-pitched voice struck her ears.\n[Since you kept your promise, it is time for me to keep mine. Tell me, what is it that you wish?]\nAs darkness set in the man’s eyes, his weakened eyes looked forward. When he opened his mouth, he spurted out bits and pieces of his organs along with a mouthful of blood. His voice seemed to be lost, as only the sound of wind passing through his vocal cord came out.\n[You do not have to speak. I can simply read your mind… So, you wish to be revived?]\nThe princess almost laughed. Wishing to be revived? What use would it be? Everything was already over.\n[No? How foolish, your life is hanging by a rope. Then what is it that you want? Don’t tell me, riches? Honor? In this situation?]\n“….”\n[What?]\nSuddenly, the tone of the darkness went up.\n[You want to start over?]\nAn ominous sensation suddenly rose up in the princess’ heart.\n[Impossible!]\nAn enraged voice shook the earth.\n[Even with your achievements, how could it be possible to reverse time!? You wanted to return everything to the way it was with only what you’ve accomplished?]\n“….”\n[Impudent! Perhaps if you accomplish today’s feats dozens of times more, but in the current state, I cannot grant your wish. Nevermind your soul, not even a single piece of your body can be sent back!]\n“….”\n[How persistent! Given that your life is about to end and the feats you have accomplished until now, I shall restrain myself. Tell me another wish.]\nThen, a heavy silence descended.\n[…Why did you make such a wish?]\nWas the darkness moved by the pitiful sight of the man dropping his head? The voice reverberating in the princess’ ears softened slightly.\n[Child, hurry and wish for your revival. If that is truly your wish, you can ask again in the future after you’ve accomplished more feats. Though, I can’t say that it will be possible.]\nThe man’s shoulders jumped ever so slightly. He seemed to be cackling. It was already a miracle just to have survived this battle. But he had to accomplish feats equaling dozens of what he accomplished already?\nThe man, the princess, and the owner of the voice all knew it was impossible.\nThe man raised his head just barely.\nHis mouth moved slightly.\n[Your memories?]\n“….”\n[You want your current feelings to…]\n“….”\n[Since you can’t send back your body or soul, you want to send back the feelings you felt here?]\nThe darkness seemed to be taken aback, as silence descended once again.\n[…Sending back feelings based on memories…. Certainly, feelings are only thoughts of your emotions.]\nAfter a long silence, the voice answered.\n[But even that is difficult.]\nAlthough it was only for a brief moment, the mouth of the dying man twisted up.\n[I am truly sorry.]\nThat was it.\nThe man’s shoulders stopped moving. Plop. His head slumped, never to rise again. Just like that, he stopped moving.\n[How foolish…]\nSuddenly, a hand-like thing reached out from the darkness. As if it had suffered a great loss, it slowly caressed the man’s head.\n“I understand.”\nThe princess, who had been watching this scene unfold, spoke up. The darkness stopped its hand.\n[You are… a descendant of the Royal Families.]\n“That is correct, O Venerable Gula.”\nThe princess smirked as if to ask why that mattered.\n“The kingdom has fallen. The gates must have been taken over by now too. With everything he’s experienced, wouldn’t it be better to die? Even though the Oath will cause him to lose his memories, that’ll only make for a cleaner ending. He will have a place to return to.”\n[No, this child didn’t wish to return.]\nThe heavy tone of the voice caused the princess’s eyes to widen.\n[He said he wouldn’t have a place to call home even if he returned.]\n“A place to call home….”\nThose words moved the princess’ heart. Perhaps, she felt a sense of camaraderie. With the kingdom’s collapse, she also didn’t have a place to call home. Although a few humans would have surely survived, their fate would be no different from that of livestock.\nAfter all, humans couldn’t become the victors of this war.\n“Then why didn’t you just grant his wish?”\nHer quiet grumbling made the darkness smile.\n[Nonsense. All effects must follow causes. No matter what, this child’s wish would have resulted in interfering with the past.]\nThe princess chuckled bitterly. She couldn’t understand, nor did she want to. It just sounded like an excuse.\n[His achievements were simply not enough to become the cause.]\n“You say that, but you seem to be regretting it quite a bit.”\n[How could I not? This child was originally born with the fate of an Executor.]\n“Executor?”\nThe princess was surprised. The Executors were the apostles who carried out the will of the seven gods. They were the seven leaders chosen to fight against the monsters threatening the world.\nThe problem was that only one of them participated in this battle.\n[Right, he shone brighter than any of the other stars. If only he didn’t ruin everything with his own hands… Why do humans only learn to regret after everything is over?]\nThe darkness fell silent. The princess also closed her mouth. She had spoken up because she didn’t want to die lonely. Although she had regained her consciousness for a brief moment, she knew from the moment she opened her eyes that she wouldn’t live for long.\nThe princess’ eyes turned to the dead man. His humble end was all the more pitiful.\nShe had no way of knowing for certain, but if he wished for the reversal of the time, he must have lived through life-or-death situations of incredible degree. But even that had not been enough to grant his wish.\nHe had fought like a dog and died like a dog, without receiving any compensation.\n“…O Venerable Gula.”\nAfter a moment of hesitation, the princess rummaged through her pocket.\n“Please grant this Earthling’s wish.”\n[Mm?]\n“The Royal Oath… you haven’t forgotten about it, have you?”\nThe darkness’ brief confusion disappeared, and it stopped talking.\nInside the princess’ wide-open palm was a beautifully crafted necklace. Although it was stained with blood, its original beauty couldn’t be hidden, as it shone brightly.\n[That is….]\n“With the oath you made to my father and this man’s achievements, wouldn’t it be enough to grant his final wish? Even if reversing time is difficult.”\n[…Do you have a reason to go this far?]\n“Of course.”\nWhen Earthlings crossed over to this world, the Royal Families also promised to reward them for their efforts. The princess had no desire to even think about the bastards who ran away from the final battle, but the Earthling in front of her had stayed until the end.\nSince he had honored his duty, it was time for her, as the princess, to honor the Royal Families’ promise. Plus, this was the final ounce of pride she could keep before dying.\n[But I can grant your own wish instead.]\n“What can you do for me?”\nThe princess laughed out loud.\nOne thing she learned from this long war was that not even gods were omnipotent. What could she even wish for in this doomed world?\n[I will say it again. This child cannot go back.]\n[Only his feelings of yearning and regret… Even those would not be etched into his mind and only pass by like a fleeting dream.]\n[He might end up treating it like an insignificant dream and forget all about it.]\n[One thing I am sure of is that both you and he will die in this place. Are you saying that this is okay?]\nThe darkness’ voice struck the princess’ ears multiple times as if to reaffirm her wish. It would be a lie if she said she didn’t have second thoughts.\nBut… she was exhausted.\nThe war had gone on for long— too long. Although she endured all this time as one of the rulers of this land, she now wanted to rest. Returning to nothingness and falling into an eternal sleep didn’t sound too bad.\n‘If only all earthlings were like you….’\nThen, she wouldn’t have had any regrets.\n[You want to grant his wish that much? Even at the cost of giving up what rightly belongs to you?]\nA smile formed on her lips for the first time.\n“Yes.”\nFinally, the wish had been decided.\n[In that case, fine.]\nShe could feel something like a pair of wings spread open from the darkness.\n[Come closer, my child.]\nSuddenly, her body turned light like a feather. By the time she noticed this, her vision had become half-blurry.\nThe world spun, and something unknown came up to her eyes.\nThe last thing she got to see was…\n[I cannot wait—]\n…a blue fragment rising above the man…\n[Until I meet the two of you again.]\nAnd the darkness laughing in joy."

    "content": "When he was young, he thought that the entire world was green. That people were green, that roads were the refreshing color of grass, that animals were dark green, and that the sky was light green. Green colors danced no matter where he looked.\nOne memory he had of his childhood was the time he went to the zoo with his family. Rather than walking around and watching the enclosures, they entered a safari, where visitors rode on a bus to tour an artificial wilderness. Paper bags filled with raw meat hung on the side of the bus.\nThe eldest brother sat on the seat next to the window, and the two-year-old sister took the mother’s lap. He recalled being a bit down, unable to sit together being neither the oldest nor the youngest.\nThe bus stopped. The wild animals lounging around the field sauntered up to the bus. The green animals jumped into a fierce competition for food. The way they pounced on each other reminded the boy of the game, Whack-A-Mole, so he laughed faintly.\nIt was then.\nA single animal. Just one. It sat on top of a boulder like an emperor, reflecting the shining sunlight.\nThe boy’s smiled disappeared. Why?\n‘Its color…?’\nUnlike any of the other animals he had ever seen, that one animal wasn’t green.\nDid it feel his gaze? The beast stared into the boy’s eyes. As if enchanted, the boy became afraid. He averted his gaze instinctively and stopped breathing. Both his hands and body trembled, and his heart pounded crazily.\nEven as he was swallowed by a terror that no boy his age was able to withstand, the boy raised a question.\nWhy wasn’t that animal green?\nNo, I must have made a mistake.\nThe boy took a deep breath and looked out the window again. It was then.\nPang!\nThe window shook violently. The beast had been far away, but it had approached the bus before the boy even noticed. But why was it ignoring the food hanging at the side of the bus and sticking to the window?\nThe beast opened its mouth and revealed its fearsome teeth, while repeatedly trying to chew on the window.\nThe boy didn’t understand what had transpired. Still, he flinched and shrunk back.\nI have to run.\nWhy isn’t the bus moving?\nI’m scared. I want to get away from here.\nMom, Mom, Mom, Mom….!\nJust as the boy was about to burst into tears, a warm hand carefully covered his eyes.\n“It must have frightened you a lot.”\nThe voice was as silvery and gentle as a spring breeze. Just that single sentence made the boy feel relaxed and relieved. The boy jumped into the woman’s embrace without checking to see who it was.\n“There, there, everything’s okay. The scary lion isn’t here anymore… Ah, the bus is moving again.”\nPat, pat. The woman gently patted the boy’s back, and his stifled breathing became relaxed. Only then did the boy raise his head to take a look.\n“Eh?”\nSuddenly, the woman’s hands stopped. She drew closer to the boy, studying him carefully. Then, she gasped in surprise.\n“Oh my goodness… Really….”\nWhen the boy tilted his head in confusion, the woman smiled.\n“Your eyes are beautiful.”\nMy eyes?\n“Yes, they’re beautiful. In the seven colors of the rainbow.”\nThe boy stared at the woman curiously, but she only smiled in return. Then, she let out a sigh, as if she found something to be a great loss.\n“If only you were a little older… No, perhaps it’s better that you grow up unaware.”\nBefore long, the safari tour ended. Tourists got up one by one, but the boy showed no sign of leaving. The woman also hesitated, as if she wasn’t ready to give up.\nThe woman whispered into the boy’s ear.\n“What’s your name?”\n“Se- Seol….”\n“Seol? That’s a pretty name.”\nShe then met the blushing boy’s gaze.\n“Hey, once you grow a bit older… and we somehow meet by coincidence, will you come to me?”\n“To you, Noona?”[1]\n“Yes, I’ll be there if you ever need my help.”\nAlthough the boy couldn’t understand what she meant, he still nodded his head in her embrace. Soon, the sound of his mother and younger sister looking for him rang out.\n“Here, promise.”\nA soft sensation touched the boy’s forehead before disappearing.\n“Let us meet again, little prince.”\nAs the boy held his mother’s hand and walked out of the bus, he looked back longingly. The woman was smiling brightly and waving her hand, all the way until the boy disappeared.\nTime passed, and the boy became an adult. He had grown until the special memories from this day turned faint.\nWith age, he lost his fear of wild animals, and he began to research the phenomenon he experienced that day.\nWhat was this ability of his?\nWhy did he have a power that no one else did?\nIn the end, he could not arrive at an answer, but he began to figure out the conditions where the green color appeared and disappeared.\nHis life began to change as he began to apply this power to his everyday life. And when this ability suddenly disappeared one day, his life rapidly spiraled out of control.\n**\nSeorak Land was a casino located in Gangwon Province’s Sokcho City.\nRegardless of winning or losing, people pressed buttons like a robot and flipped cards, as both cries of joy and despair rang out together.\n“….”\nA young man looked down at a table with a nervous expression across his face. He stole a glance at the dealer, who remained expressionless. After glaring at the table like a hungry beast, the young man opened his mouth with great difficulty.\n“Stop… No, double down!”\nThe dealer immediately put his hand on the deck, as if he had grown bored of waiting for the youth’s decision.\nThe young man’s throat dried up. His chin dripped with sweat, and his back was drenched as well. But unlike the anxious youth, the dealer flipped the card with apathy.\nThe young man wrapped his hands around his head. The sound of joy and despair once again rang out.\n*\n“Park Hyung, you got lucky today?”\n“Ah, Choi.”\nWhen a well-built man walked out of the entrance and greeted him, the bespectacled man shivering outside, while smoking a cigarette shook his head.\n“Lucky? Damn, I’m barely even. What about you?”\n“It’s the same for me. Guess today’s not my lucky day.”\n“I came outside to take a short break. I have a small headache from staying at the same table for hours on end. I figured the cold wind would cool me off.”\nWhen the bespectacled man grumbled, the well-built man grinned.\n“Yeah, I feel you… Hm?”\nJust as the well-built man began to rummage through his pocket, a loud shout suddenly struck his ears. With their eyes opened wide in surprise, the two men turned their heads to a young man on his cellphone.\nChoi furrowed his brows before tilting his head.\n“He kind of looks familiar….”\n“Who?”\n“That young man on his phone. You know him?”\n“Him? Of course, I do. That’s Seol. I think he’s been coming here longer than you. I first saw him three, four years ago.”\nChoi was inwardly impressed with how long Park had been here and stared at the young man with a shocked expression.\n“T-Three, four years? But he looks so young!”\n“Uh… He should be in his mid-20s now. He used to be famous around these parts.”\nPark licked his lips with a tinge of regret in his face. But Choi simply shrugged his shoulders.\n“Really? I’ve seen him a couple times. He didn’t look all that special.”\n“He’s like that now, but for about a year, he was the real deal. Back then, some people fought to move to his seat whenever he left.”\n“Oh? I guess he has some skills then.”\n“No, no, I wouldn’t really say he’s skilled. He’s bold, maybe? He knew when to gamble like a demon. He kept strict rules for himself, not going overboard, always bringing a set amount with himself… It felt more like he was coming here to play, not because of an addiction. Anyways, he was a weird one.”\n“How did he turn out like that, then?”\n“Who knows? He suddenly started saying he couldn’t see anymore or something. It wasn’t long until he became that….”\nPark clicked his tongue and resumed smoking his cigarette. The young man was still holding onto his cellphone. He seemed desperate as if he was pleading.\nChoi snorted.\n“It doesn’t sit well with me. A young man like him should go out there and work for his money.”\n“As long as you’re an adult, you’re free to come here, no? If you put it that way, you’re a young man too.”\n“Eii, it’s been ages since I passed forty.”\n“Does age matter? A casino is just a gambling house with a fancy title. The moment someone sets their foot inside, they’re free to lose their mind, regardless of their age.”\n“Haha, I guess that’s true.”\nBored of talking about the young man, the duo exchanged meaningless jokes and laughed.\n*\n“Father, please! Just this once! Just one last time!”\n—I’m hanging up, you bastard!\n“Father!”\nTk. The line cut off one-sidedly, and Seol immediately spat out a curse.\n“Haa…. I’m going to go fucking crazy.”\nHe had lost what little money he had left. All he had in his pockets were four casino chips, and he only had enough bills in his wallet to cover his taxi fare back. For a moment, he even considered trying his luck at the slots to recover even a little bit of what he lost.\nHowever, if he lost even that, he knew he would have to walk home.\nHis eyes scanned his contact list once more. When the name ‘Yoo Seonhwa’ showed up, he pressed the call button without hesitation. Unfortunately, it was still dawn, and no one answered the phone no matter how long he waited.\nSeol accessed the banking app and checked his balance. But that only revealed what he already knew. He sighed as he stared at the minus sign in front of the numbers.\n“Damn it, why aren’t you picking up your fucking phone….”\nAfter seething in anger for a bit, he tilted his head up and looked up at the sky. The morning sky was still grey. With a sigh, Seol raised his hand.\n“Taxi!”\n“Where are you going?”\n“Gangnam Station… No, Nonhyeon Station!”\n“Get in.”\nSoon, the taxi carrying the young man slipped into the darkness.\n\n[1] A form of address for an elder sister by a boy."

    "content": "\n“I need more money so I can go back.”\nSeol stood in front of Nonhyeon Station, pondering his next move, before finally coming to a decision. He was seemingly surrounded by enemies on all sides, but there was one secret hill he could always run to for help.\n*\nThe alarm buzzed loudly. It was 5:30 in the morning. Yoo Seonhwa opened her eyes and stretched her limbs out from a refreshing night’s sleep.\nThe morning sunlight beamed through the window and brightly illuminated a small frame on her drawer. The frame contained a photo of seven people, including Yoo Seonhwa and her younger sister. Looking at it, a faint smile bloomed on the young woman’s face.\nThere was Seol Ahjussi, who looked uptight on the outside but was warmer and more caring than anyone else on the inside; his wife, who always treated Yoo Seonhwa like her own daughter and made sure she was eating properly.\nIt wasn’t just those two in the photo, though. There was also the husband and wife’s oldest son, Seol Wooseok, who looked cold and stiff but possessed a warm heart; the youngest daughter, Seol Jinhee, who was open and outgoing; and finally…\nThere was a young man with a gentle smile in the middle of the two. Then, there she was, leaning on his shoulder and smiling radiantly.\n“….”\nLooking at the photo, a hint of worry crept into Yoo Seonhwa’s complexion. When she checked her phone to see the time, the shadow on her face grew darker.\n*\n“You’re leaving already? Why don’t you stay for a cup of coffee?” \n“Uun, I wanna do that too, but I really gotta go. I need to finish that piece and turn it in tomorrow.”\n“You didn’t forget anything? You’re good to go?”\n“Of course! I’m not a little kid. Okay, I’m heading out now! See you later!”\nThe front door closed shut, and tiny footsteps grew farther away. Left alone, Yoo Seonhwa finished her breakfast with a thin smile on her face. Her little sister’s bright face had made her energetic as well. She had been nothing but happy in the few days, so much so that she began to wonder if it was okay.\nRight, she was definitely happy. That was, if she were to disregard one little thing.\nAfter finishing her meal, she began packing her lunch with the leftovers, when she heard footsteps growing closer to her door and snickered. Koong, koong. When she heard the hasty knocks on the door, she quickly went to unlock it, as if she knew this would happen.\n“See? Didn’t I tell you to double-check every….”\nYoo Seonhwa was about to lecture her little sister but froze up on the spot instead.\n“You thought I was Seunghae?”\nThe person standing in front of her wasn’t her little sister. The man wearing clothes that were at least a couple of days old reeked like he went swimming in sewage. There were dark bags under his eyes as if he had not slept a wink.\n“You… Why are you here?”\n“Yo, it’s been a while. Have you been doing well? Wow, this place looks spotless no matter when I show up.”\nSeol entered the flat and took a look around. Once he spotted the leftovers on the kitchen table, he reached out with his dirty hands, shoved it down his mouth, and nodded with approval.\n“Delicious. I was just getting hungry, so this is perfect. Make me some breakfast.”\n“….”\n“Come on, hurry up.”\n“Who told you to come in?”\nThe young man’s eyes widened from the voice full of hostility.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“This is my house, not yours. Don’t you know that forcefully entering someone else’s house is a crime?”\n“What are you talking about? How is this place yours? I know full well my dad paid the security deposit for this place.”\n“I already paid him back a long time ago. Why are you talking about that now? Besides, even if that was true, you have no right to come in here.”\n“…Hey, don’t be like that. Between us?”\n“Between us? Really?”\nYoo Seonhwa’s voice became sharper and colder.\n“Stop dreaming. It’s over between us. You and I aren’t anything. Not anymore.”\nHer words went beyond cold and began to feel venomous. Seol rolled his eyes and let out a deep sigh. Then, with a groan, he lied down on the floor.\n“I’m starving, so make me food. I’m exhausted from walking all the way here.”\n“Hey! I’m not going to humor your antics anymore! Get up. Get up and leave before I call the police!”\nSeol snorted. But when Yoo Seonhwa really pulled out her cell phone, he hurriedly stood back up.\n“C-C’mon, can’t we talk this out? I came because I had something to say. For real.”\n“I have nothing to say to you. If you want to talk to me, go to the casino and ask them to ban you from entering. Then I’ll think about it.”\n“Wow~ Why are you so sensitive today?”\nYoo Seonhwa felt like she might explode with frustration. She shut her eyes, lowered her head, and took a heavy breath.\n“…Get out.”\n“Come on, you’re really gonna be like this?”\nBefore he could finish, a piercing shout rang out. In the end, Yoo Seonhwa exploded from her pent-up rage.\n“You think I don’t know why you’re here!? You’re here to ask me for money again!”\nSeol flinched as she had accurately hit the mark.\n“Hey, hey, what do you mean….”\nHe smiled self-consciously, trying to evade the topic, but Yoo Seonhwa was already experienced. This wasn’t the first or second time this was happening.\nIt had only been four months ago that she had told herself to trust him one final time since he got on his knees and begged for her forgiveness for several hours.\nSeeing the smile on Seol’s face that was starting to look ugly, a never-before-felt repulsion began to boil up inside her.\n“I can’t give you a single dime. No, I won’t. What? You want to start over? Am I crazy? What, it wasn’t enough that you blew away our security deposit last time!?”\nAfter blowing out the anger inside her, Yoo Seonhwa took a deep breath. She even coughed from the heated shouts.\nSeol stood there in a daze. He seemed to be at a loss of words from her adamant stance, but a cruel smirk hung on his twisted lips.\n“I’ve been patient and this is how you act? You little bitch….”\nYoo Seonhwa’s thoughts of ‘Did I go overboard?’ lasted for a brief second. She couldn’t help but doubt her own ears.\n“What did you just say?”\n“What, are your earholes blocked up now? You think I’m a fool too? Fuck.”\nIt was the first time Yoo Seonhwa was hearing Seol curse so openly. She blanked out from the sudden mental shock.\n“You of all people can’t do this to me. You clung to me when things were hard for you, but now you’re like this? I didn’t wanna bring up old tales because it’s petty, but did you forget about me taking care of you in middle school and high school? You ran around every day crying about wanting to see your mom and dad. When your little sister came crying to me about you disappearing, it was always me who went out to search for you.”\nA disgusting, nauseous feeling clogged up Yoo Seonhwa’s throat. She tried to hold it in, but her eyes became wet and hot from the feeling of betrayal.\n“What about when you wanted to go overseas and study but had no money? Didn’t I postpone my own studies and support you? I even worked part-time to send you money so that you wouldn’t starve out there!”\nIt was all true. Yoo Seonhwa wanted to go overseas to pursue her dream, but reality made it difficult. She agonized in secret as she couldn’t tell anyone about her problems, and that was when the youth in front of her stepped forward. When he delayed going back to university just to support her with his tuition, she couldn’t even describe how grateful and sorry she was.\nThat was the kind of man he was, a man who supported and cared for her more than anyone else. When they entered the same university and he confessed to her, she felt like she had obtained the world. When he promised her their future, she loved him so much she thought she might die from it.\nBut how did things turn out this way? How did he ruin himself to such a degree?\nYoo Seonhwa stood there and trembled like a lone leaf on a tree. She sniffled and then raised her head. She seemed to have calmed herself down a bit, but her eyes and nose were tinged with red.\n“…You son of a bitch.”\n“W-What?”\nSeol’s anger subsided as he stuttered. Rather than angry, he looked dumbstruck. He knew how much Yoo Seonhwa hated swearing. She had never cursed a single time in her life.\n“How much was it?”\nHer tearful voice was resolute as if she had finally made up her mind.\n“Huh?”\n“How much was it? The money you gave me when I went overseas.”\n“Uh… The tuition was 5 million, and I sent you another 2 million from working part-time.”\n“I’ll pay the tuition back to your dad. You gave me the money, but it was his to begin with. As for the 2 million, I’ll give it to you now.”\nYoo Seonhwa spoke as if she was repeatedly swallowing something. She picked up her cell phone.\n“There, I sent it. It’s 2 million exactly, so check it.”\nSeol let out a dry cough and took out his phone. After checking his bank account, he grinned.\n“Wow, you have a lot of money now. How much do you have in your bank account?”\n“Are we done now?”\nHer tearful voice came out like she was squeezing out every word from her throat. Hearing the ominous voice, Seol’s delight disappeared with a surprised flinch.\nHe looked at Yoo Seonhwa and shrugged.\n“Hey, I never asked you to give me money. If someone heard, they’d think I stole it from you or something.”\n“I paid off all my debts now, right?”\n“Uh… yeah, I guess.”\n“If you’ve confirmed it, get out. You and I have nothing to do with each other from now. Not even a debt.”\n“This again?”\nIn the end, Yoo Seonhwa couldn’t hold it back and dropped to her knees. Seeing her desperately trying to hold her tears back, the young man scratched his greasy hair.\n“Fine, fine, I’m leaving.”\nSeol, with his shoes still on, hurriedly left the flat like a burglar who was caught stealing. His refreshing sense of accomplishment only lasted a moment.\n—Huuuunng….\nWhen he heard the restrained wail from behind the closed door, he suddenly felt dirty.\nHe ran out and looked up at the sky. The morning sky was blue, a color so damnably clear.\nThe fatigue he had forgotten about rushed in. Seol returned to his flat after filling his empty stomach at a nearby convenience store. After turning on the lights, he plopped down on the dusty blanket.\nAfter some time, the midday sun went over the western horizon, and darkness began to dye the orange glow of twilight.\nBzzzz!\nA small buzz rang out, and circular ripples formed in the air. The ripples gradually gathered to a single point before instantly transforming into a blue fragment. The fragment dropped down and gently fell onto Seol’s forehead like a lover’s kiss.\nSoon, the fragment slowly sank as if it was sinking below the water.\nFlinch.\nSeol’s unmoving, sleeping body jerked.\n“!”\nAnd his eyes shot open.\n"

    "content": "\n“Huuk!”\nThe first thing Seol saw was light pressing down on his eyes. Once he focused his blurry gaze three, four times, he finally saw the lightbulb he left on before going to bed.\nSeol gasped for air and curled his body from the cold that flooded in. He found that he was soaked with cold sweat.\n“What….”\nHe wiped away the sweat on his forehead, but he couldn’t stop his body from trembling. His mind wasn’t groggy, but clear. However, he couldn’t breathe from the intense emotions swirling inside him.\nHe forced his body up and barely managed to lean against the wall. Immediately, the sigh he had been suppressing escaped from his mouth.\n“Ah….”\nSeol closed his eyes.\nA dream.\nHe had a dream. A dream that was a bit, no, a lot different than the dreams he usually had.\nHe felt as if he had personally experienced everything. He even felt all sorts of emotions from the dream.\nLogically speaking, none of it made sense. The dream was detached from the everyday life he saw and experienced. The sceneries he intermittently witnessed were far removed from the background of the modern world, and he had even fought creatures that clearly were not human. Perhaps, everything was just a silly dream.\nBut, why…?\nThe final scene was stuck in his head. The dying man… was full of regrets.\nRegret, remorse, lamentation, and a deep sigh… Even until his life flickered out, these fervent emotions raged inside him. They lingered inside Seol, ringing his heart.\nSeol opened his eyes after much struggle and slowly looked around his room.\nThe blanket tossed to the side, the clothes draped over a ramen box, bottles of soju rolling around on the dirty floor, and a pack of cigarettes sitting on the same spot.\nFor some reason, this sight felt surreal.\nA splitting migraine suddenly swept over him. He got up almost reflexively and staggered to the bathroom. Once he drew a bucket of cold water and doused his head in it, his mind turned clear.\nWhen he couldn’t hold his breath any longer, he raised his head out of the water. His own face reflecting off the bathroom mirror seemed too unfamiliar. His eyes were sunken, and his complexion was pale like a sickly man.\n‘This is… me?’\nHe slowly touched his face as light returned to his eyes. His old face was nowhere to be found, replaced by the face of an impoverished gambling and alcohol addict. He felt like he was looking at a dead man.\nHe left the bathroom without even wiping off the water dripping from his chin. He put on his jacket almost angrily and pushed the front door open.\nHis stomach ached, and he felt like he wouldn’t last much longer if he didn’t shove something down there.\nHe stopped by the convenience store, but nothing grabbed his attention. Rather than leaving his house to grab food, he had stormed out because he felt he couldn’t stay inside.\nIn the end, he left after picking out a can of beer. He began to walk aimlessly until, eventually, he reached the spot below the Tancheon River Bridge. It was the place he frequented to lament his luck whenever he lost money at the casino.\nSeol cracked open the can and gulped it down. His stomach seemed to scream, but he didn’t care.\nAs he sat in complete silence, the emotions he had been trying to ignore flooded back to him like a tidal wave.\n‘How did I end up like this?’\nSeol stared at Tancheon River’s dark waters. He was in elementary school when he realized he was different from everyone else. He called his ability ‘Green Eyes’ and considered himself a chosen child. He quivered with excitement, anticipating that something special would happen to him one day.\nLooking back, the stories of his childhood only made him blush in embarrassment.\nIt wasn’t until he got older that he learned being different from everyone else wasn’t all that good and that it was better to hide this difference.\nDuring the 26 years of his life, he had only determined four facts about his ability.\nIf he focused his senses on his eyes, living things and objects would glow green. Among them, there were some that would lose the color even if he maintained his focus. If he involved himself with things that were green, nothing would happen. But, if he involved himself with things that lost their green color, something bad would happen with over 50 percent chance.\nSeol focused on the ‘over 50 percent chance’. From a different perspective, it meant something good might have ‘under 50 percent chance’.\nThe casino was where he chose to confirm this hypothesis. At first, he simply considered the casino a place of experimentation. Although he lost 60 to 70 percent of his buy-in, he only brought one hundred thousand won every time.\nIf he lost it all, he left without turning back. Although he wasn’t happy, the amount was no different from a college kid’s allowance.\nThe problem was with the days he actually won money. One time, he had even turned his buy-in to 5 million won in two days. He ate everything he wanted, bought clothes he only imagined himself wearing, and replaced his computer to the latest model. Even then, he still had a lot left over.\nThe taste of spending money. Once he experienced it, his life began to change.\nThe number of times he visited the casino skyrocketed and the amount of money he brought with him increased as well. He forgot all about his experiments and focused on earning money.\nAs he was spending his days obsessed with winning money, his ability suddenly disappeared. It wasn’t that it was out of the blue. His head hurt the more he used his ability, and he even developed insomnia as days where he couldn’t fall asleep increased.\nAs the symptoms worsened, the green color he used to see just by focusing a tiny bit became fainter. After he passed out one time from exhaustion, he lost his ability to see the green color even after concentrating for hours.\nAlthough his greed had cost him his ability, he couldn’t stop gambling.\nHe had experienced the positive side of the variance of gambling. He believed he could recoup his losses if he won big just once.\nHe didn’t listen no matter who tried to talk sense into him. He had already fallen into the joy of gambling. The ecstasy he felt when he won was more electrifying than any other pleasure. From that point on, Seol’s life headed straight down towards the bottom of the abyss.\nAnd then, and then….\nSeol clenched his teeth. Why did he suddenly feel like this?\nBaseless pride and reckless defiance arose in his heart. But whenever this happened, the emotions he felt in his dreams flooded in and drowned them out.\nSuddenly, he recalled making Yoo Seonhwa cry in the morning. Immediately, another powerful wave of emotions swept in, making him dizzy.\n[…Son of a bitch.]\n“Ah.”\nClunk. The beer can fell from his hand and spilled on the ground.\n‘Why did I do that?’\nThe youth covered his face with his hands. He put strength into all his fingers and pressed down crazily.\n‘Just why did I do that?’\nI didn’t mean to. I shouldn’t have said something like that.\n“Damn it….”\nHe felt like a part of his heart was torn out. The emotions he felt from his dream didn’t disappear as he became more aware of them. Instead, they became clearer.\nThe feeling of regret stabbed his heart, and the edges of his eyes turned hot.\nNow, he felt like he understood the truth. That without his ability, he was just a worthless bastard.\n‘If only I never had this ability!’\nThe moment he finally accepted this truth… Seol felt the last bits of his ego being washed out of his mind.\n“Kuhuhuu…..”\nHe suddenly broke out into laughter. He burst out as if his heart would explode. But gradually, his laughter turned into weeping.\n“Heuk… I’m sorry….”\nHe regretted everything. He felt stuffy like something was strangling him.\n“I’m sorry, Seonhwa….”\nA grown youth cried like a kid.\n‘I’d rather die than continue living like this.’\nHe had lived like trash, troubling everyone around him. He couldn’t even imagine how much disappointment and pain he caused. Just like his little sister said, maybe it was better for everyone in the long run if he just took his own life.\nSeol slowly got up. The slowly flowing river water seemed more alluring than ever before.\nHe approached it as if in a trance and looked down at the river. The tears flowing down from his cheeks caused tiny ripples in the water.\nGlaring at the river fixedly, he stepped forward with his shaking legs.\nIt was then.\n“!”\nSuddenly, the color of the water changed. From the point where Seol’s feet were or, more specifically, from the point he caused the ripples, green color bloomed outward.\nLike dropping paint into clear water, the forgotten color, the lost light quickly spread out in all directions.\nNot only did it dye the flowing river water, but it also traveled up the support pillars of the bridge, dyeing the entire structure. It covered the spot he was just sitting in and, eventually, the distant sky.\nThe whole world became dyed in green, just like when he was younger.\nSeol stared at the feast of green dancing all around him with eyes wet with tears. His face was clearly one of utter disbelief.\n“This is….”\nAfter standing there like he had been struck by lightning, Seol consciously scattered his concentration. Immediately, the world returned to its normal colors.\nWhen he concentrated again, the green world returned once more.\nHis ability…\n“…It came back?”\nJust like how it suddenly disappeared one day…\n“It really came back?”\nIt suddenly returned.\n“But why?”\nHe had failed to restore his ability no matter how hard he tried. The sense of loss he felt that day could hardly be described with words.\nBut what had caused it to activate again?\nSuddenly, he recalled the morning’s dream again. Now that he thought about it, the man from this dream seemed to use the same ability.\nSeol frantically recalled the dream from the beginning.\n“….”\nBut soon, he determined that it was unrelated. It didn’t make sense no matter how much he thought about it.\nPerhaps, his subconscious desire to regain his ability had manifested itself as the strange dream. That was more realistic and easier to swallow than actually believing that the dream had anything to do with regaining his ability.\n‘Wait.’\nBut looking back, the dream was strangely realistic. Didn’t the dream also begin with the man drinking beer in Tancheon River and lamenting over his life?\nJust like how he was now.\nIt was then. \nJust as Seol fell into a new-found confusion, the click-clack of high-heels hitting the stone pavement rang out. The strange rhythmical steps caught Seol’s attention, and he promptly turned his head to the side.\nAnd there, Seol could definitely see it.\nIn the world dyed in green, the viridescent light was gradually fading away in one spot.\nIt was in the direction of this sound."

    "content": "\n“You won’t die even if you fall in there.”\nA silvery voice rang out. Her voice sounded louder than usual, perhaps because there wasn’t anyone around.\nSoon, a figure appeared from the darkness. A white blouse, a black jacket, and a grey H-line skirt that clearly outlined her curves. With a leather office bag in her hand, the woman looked to be a typical young businesswoman.\n“The water isn’t deep here. It’s only really good for a light swim.”\nHer tone went up towards the end of her sentence. Despite her appearance as a serious businesswoman, she spoke somewhat playfully.\nWhen Seol slowly stepped out of the water, the woman gave a faint smile.\n“Are you Seol….”\n“Who are you?”\nThe woman swallowed her words and approached Seol with slow, relaxed steps. With an experienced gesture, she took out her business card and pushed it towards him.\n“This is me.”\nSeol glanced at the card.\n[Sinyoung Pharmaceuticals]\n[Department Head Kim Hannah]\nWhen Seol showed no signs of accepting the card, Kim Hannah withdrew her hand, as if she was feeling somewhat awkward. Then, she handed him a handkerchief.\n“Take it. Personally, I’m not a big fan of seeing a grown man cry.”\nSeol didn’t take the handkerchief and wiped his eyes with his sleeves. Others might have been disgruntled, but Kim Hannah seemed to find Seol’s alertness interesting.\n“I once heard that a gambling addict wouldn’t move a finger even when beautiful women threw themselves at him naked. I guess it’s true.”\nSeol examined the bespectacled woman with otherworldly beauty. He felt like he had seen her in his dream.\nTo be specific, he remembered seeing her in the very first scene. A woman had approached him while he was drinking beer by Tancheon River.\nShe had said that she had great news to tell him. And it really was great news. She said she would give him enough money to pay off his debts and help him make more so long as he worked hard. When she handed over an envelope full of cash, the dream version of Seol was completely entranced.\nAlthough he had to sign a ‘contract’ in return, the dream Seol didn’t care about it at all. After all, money had practically rolled into his pocket, when he was thinking about becoming a medical test subject for extra cash.\nOf course, it wasn’t until later that he found out he had been tricked. He was dragged away to a place he’d never seen before, and the contract had actually been a slave contract.\nAlthough this happened within the dream, he shuddered when he recalled how he had toiled away like a dog.\n‘No, wait.’\nSeol suddenly realized something. Things he had regarded as a mere dream were happening in reality. Once he recognized this, his heart turned cold and his alertness peaked up.\n“You’re a lot calmer than you look.”\n“?”\n“I thought you would react if I mentioned gambling.”\nCertainly, Seol’s current reaction could only be a surprise to Kim Hannah. It was just that his attention was focused elsewhere at the moment.\n“Well, that’s better for me anyway. Looks like it will be easier to talk to you than I thought.”\n“Talk?”\n“Yep. I came to deliver gre~at news.”\nKim Hannah snickered as if she found herself funny. Meanwhile, Seol couldn’t hide his shock.\nI came to deliver great news.\nThose were the exact words he had heard in his dream. Now, he was starting to believe that his dream wasn’t just random nonsense but a premonition of things to come.\n“Hey.”\nKim Hannah put down the leather bag hanging on her right wrist. When the handle of the bag drooped down, the contents of the bag were exposed, and neatly tied stacks of 50,000 Won bills revealed themselves.\n“Why don’t we make a bet?”\nShe got down to business. She had already finished investigating the young man’s background. All that was left to do was to throw the bait.\nGambling addicts were some of the easiest people to reel in. However, she was a perfectionist. She always sought to move at the perfect timing, so that her targets would never refuse.\nAnd that was today.\nSeeing the young man staring at her bag fixedly, Kim Hannah was fully confident that she would succeed.\nSeol slowly raised his head. Kim Hannah clasped her hands as if to urge him to speak.\n“No thanks.”\n“Great, the game we’ll play is….”\nKim Hannah paused mid-sentence.\n“I quit gambling. I won’t do it.”\nWhen Seol doubled down, Kim Hannah regained her composure. She blinked her eyes quickly and tilted her head slightly.\n“Even though this can all become yours if you win just once?”\n“Not interested.”\n“What if I told you it’s yours regardless of whether you win or lose? If I remember correctly, you have quite a lot of debt to pay off.”\n“I’ll take care of it on my own.”\n“Then aren’t you interested in why I’m making you this offer?”\n“….”\n“I’ll explain everything. All you have to do is play a game with me. Of course, you can have the money too, regardless of whether you win or lose.”\nTo be completely honest, it was an enticing offer. Even at a glance, Seol could count at least forty stacks of bills. The woman seemed trustworthy from the confident way she spoke. Hearing her out didn’t seem like such a bad idea.\nJust as Seol was about to nod his head in agreement, an alarm bell resounded in his head. The leftover emotions from his dream from earlier in the day shook violently in fierce defiance.\nAt the same time, he could feel a strange attraction. Inside the contradictory swirl of emotions, Seol took heavy breaths.\n‘Did I almost… make another huge mistake?’\nNo matter how vivid a dream was, one would quickly forget about it after waking up. Since Seol remembered her even now, didn’t that mean she played an important role? Seol told himself to remain cautious.\nSeol’s suspicion was correct. Her words, ‘All you have to do is play a game with me’, could be interpreted in all sorts of ways.\n“I refuse.”\nOh yeah? Kim Hannah mumbled inwardly.\nHis reaction was a surprise for sure. Kim Hannah had expected Seol to jump at her like a starving beast the moment he saw the stacks of money. That was the Seol that Kim Hannah knew.\nBut this situation wasn’t completely unexpected either. Occasionally, there were those like him, fools who acted tough to get more out of her.\nKim Hannah adjusted her internal evaluation of Seol. He didn’t seem all that bad. At the very least, he seemed to be better than reckless idiots. Unfortunately…\n‘You picked a wrong opponent, you bastard.’\nThis wasn’t her first rodeo. She knew full well how to convince people like him.\n“How troublesome….”\nKim Hannah pretended to cross her arms and pressed the inner pocket of her jacket.\nBuzz— Something vibrated.\n“Ah, sorry, hold on a moment.”\nShe took out her phone and skillfully put on her earbuds.\n“Yes, this is Kim Hannah. Ah~ Yes, I’m talking to him right now. Yes, yes…. Really? So we’re recruiting that person?”\nGlance. Kim Hannah snuck a quick glance at Seol. Then…\n“Yes! Of course, that’s fine. My client refused. Anyways, I’ll head back then~”\nShe took off her earbuds and smiled.\n“What a coincidence. The last slot we had was filled up just now.”\nKim Hannah emphasized the phrase ‘last slot’.\n“Well, since you refused, I guess it works out. Excuse me, then. I sincerely hope you can achieve everything you’ve set out to do.”\nKim Hannah picked up the leather bag and turned back without a shred of hesitation. She then began to walk away, step by step.\nFrom her experience, she expected one of two things to happen. He would either stop her immediately or wait a bit until hurriedly running after her.\n“Wait.”\nKim Hannah smirked.\n“Yes, what is it?”\nShe turned her head slightly. Her teasing expression that seemed to say ‘what’s up?’ was just a bonus.\n‘You were a bit different from my expectation, but you think the likes of you can win against me?’\nShe made a triumphant smile. It was then.\n“If it isn’t the Contract….”\nSeol opened his mouth.\n“If it isn’t the Contract, I’ll hear you out.”\nThat was it. With just that single sentence, Kim Hannah’s train of thought completely paused.\nBlink, blink. She stared at the man in front of her with her jaws open.\n“…Come again?”\nShe barely managed to eke out a reply.\n“What I want….”\nWhat followed afterward…\n“…is an Invitation, not a Contract.”\n…completely destroyed every scenario she had imagined.\n“…You.”\nKim Hannah’s smiling face vanished completely. She slowly took off her glasses as her expression turned icy cold.\n“Who are you?”\nHer way of talking changed. A hint of hostility could even be felt from her tone.\n“You already know.”\nSeeing the woman drop her polite manner of speech, Seol also talked more casually. Kim Hannah’s glaring gaze turned sharper.\n“You’re already from that side?”\n“You should know that’s not true better than anybody else.”\nKim Hannah almost agreed. She had picked out Seol as one of her targets half a year ago. Until now, he had not acted strangely in any way.\nMoreover, if he had gone over even once, he should have that on his body. However, she couldn’t feel the aura of the ‘Mark’. This was clear proof that Seol had no direct relationship with the other world.\nFaced with a situation she hadn’t imagined in the slightest, Kim Hannah wasn’t quite sure what to do. As far as she was aware, this couldn’t be happening.\n“You want me to believe that? Even though you know the difference between an Invitation and a Contract?”\n“What about it? Am I not allowed to say ‘invitation’?”\nSeol’s shameless response made Kim Hannah bite her lips.\n“I’m not here to play with words. Who was it? Who contacted you first?”\n“That’s not important.”\nSeol purposely changed the topic. Everything he said until now came from his dream. Both the Invitation and the Contract.\nHe had just thrown it out there as his feelings told him to. Since there was no way for Kim Hannah to know the truth, he figured it was better to let her misunderstand. After all, this was the only weapon of deception he had against her.\n“What’s important is that I want an Invitation, not a Contract.”\nHearing this, Kim Hannah took a deep breath.\n“Fine, don’t tell me if you don’t want to. I’m curious, but I have no reason to hear you out.”\nOne, two, three, four. Kim Hannah counted numbers in her head to calm herself down. She had the feeling she was being swept away at the young man’s pace.\n“Other than that, tell me why you would want an Invitation.”\n“Because I’m not interested in taking the Contract and living as a slave.”\nSeol answered simply. Kim Hannah’s eyebrows twitched.\n“Tell me why I have to use my precious Invitation on a worthless gambling addict!”\nSeol flinched. Before he even realized it, he was treating the morning’s dream as reality. With that in mind, he couldn’t help but wonder if he should continue.\nIt wasn’t too late. He could end the conversation now and pretend today’s talk never happened. He had already resolved himself to quit gambling. He could start to regain the trust he’d lost by getting an honest job and working earnestly.\nHowever, when he declared he wasn’t interested in taking the Contract, the unknown sense of repulsion he’d been feeling vanished. Now, the strange sense of attraction was the only thing that remained.\nHe was curious in his own way. There was something he wanted to confirm as well.\nSeol recalled the dream’s final scene. The dying man’s emotion of regret was now pushing Seol forward. It was telling him to go forward.\nSeol finally understood what he previously felt. In order to go there, he had to absolutely refuse to take the Contract.\nSeol clenched his teeth. He scavenged through his memories with all his focus.\n“You might regret it if you don’t give me an Invitation.”\n“What?”\n“You said you were Shinyoung Pharmaceuticals’ Manager Kim Hannah, right?”\n“So?”\n“Shinyoung is famous for continuously developing new medicine these past few years… It has something to do with that world, right?”\nSeol’s bid for victory worked. The calm expression Kim Hannah had been trying to maintain crumbled down.\nBefore having today’s dream, Seol knew nothing about the other world. It was obvious that information about it was being kept a secret from the public.\nHe didn’t know whether Kim Hannah was forced to keep silent or doing so voluntarily, but he assumed it was a weakness worth prodding. Since the current Seol was an ordinary civilian with no restrictions on his freedom, he didn’t need to hold back.\n“I wouldn’t even need to open my mouth. The 21st century is known as the Information Age, after all.”\n“You’re threatening me?”\n“You’re the one who tried to trick me first. What comes around goes around.”\n“Funny. You think anyone would believe you? A gambling addict of all people?”\n“…Well, I guess you’re right.”\nWhen Seol readily admitted his error, Kim Hannah felt a sense of unease rising in her heart. Just how was he so relaxed?\n“But would your superiors think the same way?”\nCrack. The sound of gritting teeth rang out.\n“Can’t even complete a simple Contract, can’t keep an important secret… I’m sure they’ll love you.”\n“You son of a bitch!”\nKim Hannah finally dropped her façade. Seol could tell he was getting close. He knew getting a scammer to curse was no different than making them wave the white flag.\nHe briefly considered provoking her further but quickly decided against it. Now that he had whipped her a few times, it seemed like a good idea to gently appease her. After all, she was the one who held the final decision.\n“Of course, I don’t want to go that far either. You just have to give me one Invitation.”\nSeol took a step back. Kim Hannah was still gritting her teeth with a vicious face.\n“A Contract and an Invitation are two completely different matters. I can complete Contracts with my authority, but not an Invitation.”\n“Didn’t you say something about your ‘precious Invitation’ just now?”\nMotherfucker. Kim Hannah bit her lower lip.\n‘Some motherfucking deity you are. You said a time would come when I would have no choice but to use it. Is this what you meant?’\nKim Hannah ruffled her neatly combed hair as she cursed out another world’s god.\n“I’m not lying. I have to receive permission for a normal Invitation.”\nSeol shrugged. Seeing his calm demeanor, Kim Hannah’s boiling head gradually simmered down.\nThe Contract was a business. The Invitation carried a different meaning, but it was technically an extension of that business. In that sense, Seol had surpassed Kim Hannah’s expectations. He seemed to be a real talent rather than a slave. He made her feel like she was dealing with a veteran who had toiled away on that side for several years.\nOf course, she knew that couldn’t be the case.\nAfter collecting her breath, Kim Hannah opened her phone. But before she pressed the call button, an intense internal struggle stopped her.\n‘Damn it, just how did I end up with this son of a bitch…’\nChanging a Contract to an Invitation wasn’t an easy thing to do. No matter how much she embellished her words, it would be difficult to escape being blamed. As a career-centric woman, Kim Hannah couldn’t stand having her record get blemished.\nShe spoke, with her phone still turned on.\n“You have to agree to three conditions.”"

    "content": "“Conditions?”\nSeol asked back.\n“Do you want to hear me out or no?”\n“I’m listening.”\n“Number one. You have to swear that you’ve never entered that world before. Right here, right now.”\n“Sure, that’s easy.”\n“Number two. I want you to tell me your secret when I hand over the Invitation. About how you already knew these things…”\n“I can’t do that.”\nSeol immediately refused.\n“What makes you think I would? I have nothing more to say about that.”\n“Even if I give you a special Invitation?”\nSpecial Invitation? The phrase piqued Seol’s curiosity, but he shook his head.\n“No. If I get to trust you a little more in the future, then maybe. But not now.”\nSince he couldn't be a 100 percent sure about Kim Hannah, he left room for interpretation.\nKim Hannah tilted her head back slightly. Looking at the night sky, she let out a long sigh.\n“….The final condition. After you successfully enter that world, you have to negotiate with me first before anybody else, no matter what. Understood?”\n“What if I fail?”\n“Unless you’re a retard beyond imagination, that won’t ever happen. I’ll forcefully drag you into that world if I have to.”\nHearing Kim Hannah’s heated declaration, Seol did some calculations in his head. It seemed that Kim Hannah would not concede on the last point. If he didn’t agree, not even a Contract seemed possible, much less an Invitation.\n'It looks like this Invitation thing really is precious….’\nSince she used the word ‘negotiation’, Seol guessed that she had abandoned all thoughts of a slave contract. After assessing his options, Seol made his decision.\n“I accept.”\n“….Good.”\nKim Hannah put her phone away. She sighed yet again before reaching into her pocket and rummaging through it. Judging by how much her hand trembled, Seol guessed how reluctant she was to use this Invitation.\nWhen her hand finally came out of her pocket, four stamps were locked between each gap between her fingers. One was colored red, the other ones were bronze, silver, and finally, gold.\n“You said you won’t sign the Contract….”\nKim Hannah removed the red stamp.\n“As for the bronze…. I can use it with my authority, but it’s still a shared asset. I don’t even need to mention the silver.”\nThe way she spoke while coincidentally waving her middle finger around got on Seol's nerves a bit, but he endured. The sole remaining stamp was the gold one. That was her so-called ‘precious Invitation’.\nWith an anguished look, she tightened her hand around the gold stamp. Then, she rushed towards Seol as if to devour him on the spot.\n“W-Wait!”\n“What? Aren't we finished talking now? You wanted an Invitation, right?”\n“What is that gold stamp….”\n“It's my life, you bastard!”\nWith a frustrated shout, Kim Hannah snatched up the retreating Seol's left arm. Then, she pressed the gold stamp on his palm as though it was a dagger. Immediately, a golden light flashed. The light shone upwards before dissipating like a receding tide and becoming grey.\nFeeling completely mystified, Seol shifted his gaze down at his left palm. Right in the middle, a small, round mark was emitting a reddish-gold light. Although it quickly vanished in the next moment, Seol was still mesmerized by the sight.\nNext, an envelope slapped him in the chest. Seeing how luxuriously packaged it was, he guessed that it was the Invitation letter.\n“The Gate will open at 10:30 PM, tonight. It's around two hours from now, so take care of your personal affairs. As for that letter, I don't really care if you read it or not.”\nWhile clutching the bag full of money, Kim Hannah abruptly turned on her heels to leave. Just as she took several steps away, she trembled noticeably and turned around to glare at him one final time.\n“You…. You better survive. I don't care what you do, so survive and enter that world. Got it!?”\n“?”\n“If you die after all of this, let's see what happens! I'll get back every little thing you owe me even if I have to chase you to the ends of the Earth, understand!?”\nShe must have been furious as her voice was laced with incredible killing intent. After that little outburst, she quickly disappeared into the darkness.\nSeol plopped down on his butt. It felt like a wild storm just swept by a second ago. He danced along to the tune being played at the time, but now that it was over, he felt completely drained.\nSeol clenched and loosened his left fist a couple of times before shifting his focus to the Invitation letter. There was one letter neatly folded inside the envelope.\nFor some reason, he ended up recalling his past while feeling rather proud of himself. He had never received an invitation before, either in his life or during that dream of his, but now that he did, he was somewhat moved.\nSeol carefully opened the letter.\nGreetings!\nWe would like to thank you for accepting our Invitation to Lost Paradise, a foreign world that is connected to ours.\nLost Paradise is a world for the select few.\nA world full of heart-pounding adventure and dazzling riches! It is a world of living, breathing legendary ruins and fierce competitions!\nThis Invitation letter will guide the honorable guest to the steps of Eden and help you escape the drudgery of everyday life!\n*This Invitation letter is only issued to an honourable guest with the approval of the golden stamp.\n*The opening time for the Gate is 10:30 PM, March 16th, 2017. We recommend that the guest open this letter at that time in a secluded place.\n*This Invitation letter is required during the confirmation of the Marking as well as the starting bonus giveaway. Do not lose this letter and please bring it with you.\n*This Invitation letter allows the honored guest to bring along another person as an aide.\n“Ah, crap.”\nSeol stopped reading every little word of the letter and took a look at his phone. The time was already well past eight and racing towards nine.\n'I don't have a lot of time left.'\nSeol complained slightly before a wry smile formed on his lips. Kim Hannah told him to take care of personal affairs, but he didn't have much to do. His family had disowned him, and he didn’t have any close friends either. Even if he didn’t contact anyone for one or two months, no one would bat an eye.\nIn fact, they would probably be happy that he wasn’t bothering them.\nIn any case, there wasn’t much he could do with the remaining time. He wasn’t told to prepare anything either.\nIt was at this moment that Seol recalled Yoo Seonhwa.\n“….”\nSeol shoved the Invitation letter inside his pocket and got up from his seat. All of a sudden, he felt like he was running short on time.\nSeol immediately headed to a sauna. He scrubbed himself thoroughly and cut his hair at the barber’s inside the sauna. Just like that, one hour flew by.\nBefore he could even enjoy the refreshed feeling he had been lacking for days, he raced to his flat fast enough to give superheroes a run for their money. He switched to the cleanest set of clothes he could find, stopped by an ATM to withdraw 2 million Won, caught a taxi, and headed off to Nonhyeon-dong.\nWhile on his way there, he worried constantly.\nDo I have to go? She probably doesn’t want to see me ever again. She even said it herself!\nMaybe it’ll be better for both of us if I just send her the money through the bank.\nHowever, Seol soon realized that going there personally would only serve as self-satisfaction. Seol knew how much he hurt Yoo Seonhwa with his words. He wanted to apologize, even if that meant receiving a well-deserved slap in the face.\nHis heart pounded louder and faster the closer he got to Yoo Seonhwa's home. After reaching the front door, Seol collected his breath and rang the bell. But no matter how long he waited, no one answered.\nTok, tok. He knocked on the door several times, but it was still dead silent. Seol checked the time and noted that he had less than ten minutes remaining.\n'Is she still at work?'\nHe fiddled with his phone and then sat down on the staircase leading to the corridor.\n'Am I doing the right thing?'\nNow that he had come this far, he could no longer call that dream a fantasy. After all, the things he saw and experienced in the dream had become a reality.\nAlthough he talked big to Kim Hannah, he was rather worried about the whole thing. Of course, he had already spilled the milk, and the die had been cast. He had no choice but to face the upcoming challenges head-on.\nSeol decided to think optimistically. Since he was brave enough to consider drowning himself, he could surely use that bravery to accomplish greater things.\nJust as he made up his mind, the clock reached 10:30. Seol looked around his vicinity and saw no one.\nDing!\nAlmost at that exact moment, he heard a chime coming from the elevator. He saw a triangular green light indicating ‘1’. Someone was coming up.\nBefore he lost the chance, Seol hurriedly pulled out the paper bag containing 2 million Won. Then, he got on his knees and shoved the bag inside the mail slot of the door.\nJust as he finished, a circular light appeared above Seol's position. The mysterious light swallowed him before vanishing without a trace. This happened in the blink of an eye.\nShortly afterward, the elevator door opened, and a lone woman stepped out. With a look of exhaustion and depression, Yoo Seonhwa unlocked the front door and entered her place.\nShe took an enervated step forward, only to gently kick something.\n“Hm?”\nHer eyes widened after spotting a weighty paper bag by her feet. After checking its content, she quickly turned around in stunned silence.\nHowever, she could only see the lonely darkness quietly settling down on the empty corridor of the apartment.\n**\nSeol felt cold, perhaps because of the chilly air tickling his toes. He reached out absentmindedly to search for his blanket, but the only thing his wandering fingers could grasp was a pillow.\nHe hugged the pillow tightly, but the chill remained. And now that his brain had woken up, it didn't want to go back to sleep. It let this fact be known with a small but insistent migraine.\nIn the end, Seol opened his eyes.\nFeeling somewhat groggy, he took a look around. No matter how many times he looked, this place was still his rented flat.\nStartled, Seol hurriedly looked down at his left palm. It was clean. He carefully studied it, but there wasn’t a single indication of a mark.\n“Ha. Hahaha….”\nA bitter chuckle escaped his lips.\n“It was all a dream?”\nHe chuckled hoarsely to himself before lying flat on the floor.\n“Right, of course. Why would someone like me get the chance to…. Damn it! Are you trying to make fun of me or something…?”\nLike a man who had lost his mind, he stared at the ceiling for a long time before switching on the television.\n—….Earlier, the temperature had been dropping below freezing point, but at the moment, Seoul's temperature is hovering around 2.4 Celsius. It's higher than what it was same time yesterday….\nThe darkened screen gradually flickered into life, and the clear voice of a weather-girl entered his ears. But rather than watching the TV, Seol grabbed his cigarette packet and lightly shook it. He pulled out one of the two remaining cigarettes and stuck it between his lips. Then, he changed the channel.\n—Sinyoung Pharmaceuticals has announced that they have developed a new medicine….\nSeol's gaze chased away the faint grey smoke and landed on the TV's screen.\nThe news channels were carrying the stories of new medications entering the market as their top headlines for the past few days. Since Seol's ‘dream’ had been so vivid, he naturally ended up paying attention to the news piece.\n—Located in the city of Seoul, Sinyoung Pharmaceuticals is a medical research firm established four years ago for the purpose of developing new medicine. More expectations are being placed on them as they have shown concrete results today as well….\nThe image on the screen changed, and a man wearing an unkempt, white lab gown showed up.\n—….It possesses the characteristics of antioxidants that suppress the origin of the inflammation, as well as boosting the level of testosterone in the blood….\nPerhaps because of the cigarette smoke, Seol's dizziness seemed to intensify. He crawled towards the nearest window, reached out, and opened it wide. He immediately felt a bit better when the cold wind hit his face.\nHe leaned against the wall, before sliding down to a squat in a quiet, absentminded daze. He stared at the TV spitting out unimportant and indecipherable babble and, almost out of habit, reached down to his pocket.\n“!!!”\nHe flinched. His hand stopped. He felt as if every single cell in his left hand had woken up. Slowly, ever so slowly… he pulled out the object caught between his fingers. A familiar paper envelope revealed itself.\nIt was the Invitation letter.\nSeol abruptly raised his head the moment his phone started vibrating.\n[The message from the Guide has arrived. We recommend that all the Contracted and Invited guests confirm the message immediately.]\nSeol instinctively stood up after that robotic announcement hit his eardrums. When he hurriedly looked outside his window, his jaw became slack.\n“What the….?”"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 7. The Golden Stamp (2)",
    "content": "Desolate.\nThere was something unnatural about the streets for Seol to simply describe them that way. For one, he couldn't spot a single person or a moving vehicle.\nWhat he saw was a dreary and bleak cityscape without a single ant in sight. Even the sky above was a shade of dull grey.\n'So it wasn’t a dream? It was all real?’\nRealizing this, Seol practically flew towards the smartphone and picked it up.\n[Identity confirmed. The registration of the user has been completed.]\nA robotic voice came from the device and the screen lit up next. He hurriedly tapped on the mail icon blinking on the corner, and texts appeared on the screen.\n[Sender: The Guide]\n[1: Arrive at Paradise High School's assembly hall before the time runs out.]\n[2: Remaining time - 00:09:45]\nThe content was simple, but the sender had also kindly attached an image that turned out to be a map. He took a look and found that his current location wasn't too far from his new destination.\nSeol slapped his own cheeks, hard. Of course, his face stung quite a lot. He was trying to see if that would wake him up, but he mainly wanted to use the pain to reaffirm that this was indeed happening for real.\n“….Ouch.”\nHe rubbed his aching cheeks and cautiously pushed the front door open to leave.\n*\nWhile he walked, an unexplainable tension continued to rear its ugly head. Besides the loneliness born out of feeling like the last man on earth, it felt like he was walking around while the world around him was frozen in time.\nFinding his way around wasn't difficult at all. He simply followed the direction indicated on the map and needed only two minutes to arrive at the destination.\nThe eye-catching plaque shouting out 'Paradise High' hung next to the wide-open front gates of the school.\n'What a funny name.'\n“That name stinks.”\nAn unexpected voice surprised Seol, and he quickly looked to his side. He didn't even know when she had arrived, but a girl with a hoodie was standing there.\nTheir eyes met. Her flawless pale skin indicated her young age, but her arched up brows seemed to indicate her rather fierce personality.\nJust as Seol got this impression of uncaring disinterest from her expressionless face, she brushed past him. Both of her hands were shoved deep within the pockets as she quickly stepped past the open gates. She seemed to be in a hurry for some reason.\n'The white roof, right?'\nThe attached map said this was the location, but that didn't mean this very spot was the meeting point. Seol looked around and found the assembly hall. As he approached it, he could hear the murmurs of the people within.\nSeol climbed up the steps, only to come to an abrupt halt. An unexpected person was standing by the entrance of the hall.\nTo be more specific, a blonde woman wearing a full-on maid outfit was graciously waving her hand at Seol. It was as if she was saying, “please, over here, welcome, sir….”\n“Uhm… Am I supposed to enter through here?”\nNod, nod.\nThe blonde woman silently nodded her head and smiled brightly. But when Seol tried to walk past her, she trotted to his front and blocked his path. She quietly stared at him and suddenly reached her hand out.\n“?”\nSeol tilted his head in confusion. Then, the blonde woman's lips opened without letting out a sound. She used both the index fingers and thumbs of her hands to form a rectangle before reaching out to him again. It was as if she was telling him to hand something over. Unfortunately, Seol could only stand there, blinking his eyes in further confusion.\n“Do you need something from me?”\nAs if Seol was making her frustrated, the blonde maid narrowed her eyes in an elegant manner. Her cheeks even puffed up, and her lower lip stuck out in a slight pout. This only caused Seol to fall further into his state of confusion.\n“She wants your Invitation letter! Or your Contract paper!”\nAs he stood there wondering what to do, someone shouted out from inside the hall. Seol took a look and found a guy sitting on a chair inside the assembly hall, giggling while spectating what was happening out here. Finally going ‘Oh!’, Seol pulled his Invitation letter out from the pocket and handed it over.\n“Hmph.”\nThe woman received the letter and opened it while carrying a prim expression. While Seol stood next to her wondering whether that hmph was her trying to say something or simply her short snort, the maid's expression gradually froze up.\nShe looked at the Invitation letter. Then, she looked back at Seol.\nHer wide-open eyes slowly closed shut. She carefully folded the Invitation letter, gathered both of her hands in front of her chest, and slowly lowered herself in a deep bow. It was an elegant yet dignified greeting.\nSuddenly, the entire assembly hall fell silent. The attention of everyone who had arrived here before Seol focused on the newest arrival. Completely disregarding all those stares, the blonde maid pointed towards the left side of the hall and guided the flustered and even more confused Seol there.\nThe maid guided him towards an empty chair, and bowed politely once more, before smoothly retreating away as if she was riding on skates while never turning her back to him. She still didn't say a single word, yet her attitude towards him had definitely changed.\n“What's the matter with her? Why is she acting like that all of a sudden?”\n“I wonder. She didn't do that when I showed up.”\nThe eyes of two particular men landed on the new arrival that was Seol. But all he could feel at that moment was the sense of being confused and flustered.\nEven though he had come here in that super-vivid dream, in reality, this was his actual first time. And certain things were progressing rather differently compared to the dream, too.\nSo, of course he was flustered. That was why he decided to divert his attention and try to suss out his new environment instead.\nThe number of people gathered in the assembly hall was well over 30. What was especially noticeable was that they were divided into left and right sides as if to separate the two.\nThe left side with Seol in it only had eight people in total — six men and two women. They were furnished with chairs to sit on, and the general atmosphere was relaxed and easy-going.\nOn the other hand, the right side had almost thirty people, but they were either sitting on the floor or standing up. Seol could see that the atmosphere there was anxious as well.\n“It must be fate, meeting in a place like this. Why don't we introduce ourselves to each other?”\nA man suddenly spoke up. He looked bored from all the waiting. He was also the one giggling at Seol just now.\nHis loud and manly voice managed to attract the attention of everyone present. The front part of his hair was slicked back to reveal his equally manly face. A faint smile formed on his lips as if he enjoyed being the center of attention.\n“Nice to meet you all. I’m Kang Seok. And these two guys over here…. Hey, guys, introduce yourselves.”\n“I'm Yi Hyungsik.”\n“Jeong Minwoo.”\nIt was unclear if they were friends before coming here or became friends after arriving. The two men briefly introduced themselves. Seol inwardly assigned nicknames to both of them since their physical traits were rather distinct. He nicknamed the former, 'Skinny', and the latter, 'Fatty'. As for the first guy who spoke up, Seol gave him the nickname, 'Rock'.\n“What's your name?”\nKang Seok's next target was the woman wearing the hoodie, the one Seol ran into at the school's gate.\nShe seemed to be completely uninterested. It was as if she wasn't even listening to what was being said around her, only immersing herself on the phone's screen. In other words, she was ignoring Kang Seok’s question.\nKang Seok scratched his head and awkwardly smiled.\n“She must be one of those picky and arrogant women. Without a doubt.”\nYi Hyungsik chimed in.\n“That’s kinda embarrassing… Is there anyone willing to save me?”\nKang Seok's gaze landed on the remaining woman of the group. She tightly squeezed the hand of a teen boy sticking close to her and awkwardly smiled.\n“Oh… my name is Yi Seol-Ah.”\n“So, it's Miss Seol-Ah. How about the gentleman next to you?”\n“He’s my little brother, Yi Sungjin.”\nUpon hearing the words ‘little brother’, Kang Seok seemed more interested.\n“You two are blood siblings?”\n“Yes, we are.”\n“May I ask how old you are? I mean, you two seem a bit too young to be here. Oh, my apologies if that offended you.”\n“Oh, no. It's fine. I'm eighteen and Sungjin is two years younger than me.”\n“Wow.”\nKang Seok let out a surprised gasp as if he found this fact quite surprising. He quickly formed a beaming smile and offered his hand.\n“Oh, that means I can drop the formal speech. I'm twenty-nine this year. Since we all received Invitation letters, let's get along well. Think of me as a reliable uncle.”\n“Oh, um… Thank you very much.”\nYi Seol-Ah bashfully shook his hand. Her graceful appearance and that shyness reminded Seol of a freshly picked beautiful flower. He couldn't take his eyes off her for a moment or two. Even Kang Seok didn't let go of her hand for a while.\nThe remaining two were Seol and a man wearing a green cap and a pair of sunglasses.\nThe cap-wearing man was busy moving his lips up and down as if he was chewing on a piece of gum, while listening to music through the earphones stuck to his ears. His legs also moved along to the beat, leading to an overall impression of him being a bit of a restless busybody. He also didn't introduce himself as if such things didn't interest him.\nSeol quietly gathered his focus and stared at Kang Seok. The green light appeared on him for a brief moment before dissipating.\nThe odds of nothing good happening by mixing up with him were high enough. In the end, Seol turned his head away.\nHe got pretty flustered when entering the assembly hall, but as time passed, he had gradually calmed down.\nThe Seol of the dream was standing on the right side of the hall, which meant that things were different now. Just what was that golden stamp and why did it warrant such different treatment? He tried to go through his memories once more for answers, but he couldn't recall anything.\n'I'll get to find out, eventually.'\nWhen he checked his phone for the time, he saw the countdown tick from “00:00:01” to “00:00:00”.\n“It's time.”\nSuddenly, a voice came from the front of the hall. On the stage, a tuxedo-wearing man walked up in a dignified, disciplined manner. Everyone present was quite surprised since there was no one there just a moment ago.\nThe stylishly dressed man sported a clean and neat hairstyle, as well as a monocle over his eye. He raised a hand towards the blonde maid standing by the entrance.\n“Is this everyone?”\nThe maid shook her head softly, pointed towards the group on the right side of the hall, and then raised four fingers up.\n“Four people…. Well, it's fine. We can't wait any longer, so just close the door and unleash it.”\nWhen the blonde maid showed some sign of hesitation, the man who kind of resembled a head butler narrowed his eyes.\n“I am the Guide. It's not like it’s difficult to get here. Those who can't even adhere to the schedule aren't needed here.”\nIn the end, the maid obediently lowered her head and quietly closed the door shut. She then produced a smartphone and tapped away for a little while.\nMeanwhile, the man on the stage clapped his hands twice to draw everyone’s attention towards himself.\n“Welcome. I am called Han, tasked with guiding all of you this time around. You can call me the Guide.”\nHan spoke up to here and gestured at the maid with his index finger. She quickly ran to his side, while her blonde ponytail danced in the air.\n“First of all, the Contract documents, please. How many do we have? Twenty-eight…. Quite a lot, isn't it? And we have eight Invitations this time?”\nThe Guide didn't even take a look at the bundle of the Contracts and simply shoved them underneath his jacket. However, he still held onto the Invitation letters tightly in his hand.\nThe Guide played with his monocle.\n“Ehem, firstly, let us confirm the identities of those present today. Although we have the Invitation letters here, it's meaningless if we don't personally confirm.”\nThe silence still remained inside the assembly hall. The Guide simply smirked.\n“I'm sure that you're curious about many things. But let us follow the protocol. Everyone present here, please, think of bringing up your Status Windows, or simply yell Status in your minds. It's fine to say it out loud, as well.”\n'Status Windows? Status?' Just as Seol thought like this….\nIn the empty air right in front of his eyes, a sudden avalanche of texts came crashing down.\n[Your Status Window]\n[1. General Information]\nSummoned date: March 16th, 2017.Marking Grade: GoldSex/Age: Male/26Height/Weight: 180.5 cm/80.6 kgCurrent Condition: GoodClass: LV. 0 (Invited)Nationality: Republic of Korea (Area 1)Affiliation: N/AAlias: N/A\n[2.

Level of Cognition]—Will be available after the conclusion of the Tutorial event.\n“Ohh….”\n“Wha, what the hell is this?”\nPeople began gasping in surprise everywhere. Seol was no exception. Although he had seen this tens and hundreds of times before in his dream, now that he was experiencing it personally, it really felt quite a lot different.\n“What’s this ‘Innate Ability’ thing? Hey, Hyungsik, what does yours say?”\n“Excuse me? Do you perhaps possess an Innate Ability?”\nThe person who answered Kang Seok wasn't Hyungsik but the Guide, Han. Kang Seok didn't expect his words to be overheard from this far, so he got flustered while he shook his head in denial.\n“N-No, I don't have one. I was just curious.”\n“Oh…. Well, it's only normal for you to not have an Innate Ability. That's how it is with most humans. You don't have to mind that section of your Status Window.”\nHan smiled brightly as he spoke.\n“Well, then. Let's stop being surprised, shall we? This time, please reveal the grades of your Marks. Just like before, just think about it or speak it out loud, and it will be done. Don’t worry, I won't be able to see anything besides what's been revealed.”\nThe assembly hall got a bit noisy. However, Seol was still intensely staring at his Status Window.\nThe Guide definitely said it was normal to not have any Innate Abilities. However... the Window in front of Seol's eyes showed that he had them. Two, as a matter of fact.\n'Future Vision? And what's with the question marks?'\nHe suspected that it was somehow related to his ability to see green colors, but what was up with the question marks?\n“Let's see…. Since we don't have a lot of time remaining, I shall just directly move to the next step in the procedure. Miss Yi Seol-Ah, Mister Yi Sungjin, Mister Yi Hyungsik, Mister Jeong Minwoo, and Mister Hyun Sangmin? You all have the Bronze Marks, yes? Oh, indeed you do.”\nFive people out of the left side's eight nodded their heads before staring at the Guide with somewhat befuddled eyes.\nThe Guide asked and answered his own question, then he threw five Invitation letters in the air. Suddenly, the letters shone brightly before transforming into five bronze-colored bags that fell down to the ground. It was all just like a fancy magic trick.\n“The Bronze Marks will only receive one Random Box as per the regular bonus item rules. You could also have asked for the bonus of bringing along a helper, but I see that none of you have done so, regrettably.”\nThe blonde maid picked the five bronze-colored bags and handed them over to their respective owners. Meanwhile, the Guide unfolded two more Invitation letters. While reading the contents, he carried on.\n“We advise you to immediately activate your bonus items right away. The Tutorial will begin soon, so it'd be a pity if you died without using them…. Ohh?”\nThe Guide's eyes always maintained a level of disinterest, but a small glint of surprise flickered in them now.\n“Hoh. We have two silver Marks. I'm genuinely looking forward to guiding all of you. Mister Kang Seok? Miss Yun Seora?”\n“Yes!”\nKang Seok shouted out energetically. The hoodie-wearing girl, Yun Seora, simply nodded her head once.\n“For the Silver Marks, two regular Random Boxes, and special bonus items unique to the Invited, will be provided. Mister Kang Seok won't receive the special bonus item, but there is one for Miss Yun Seora.”\nThis time too, the Invitation letters turned into bags as they fell down to the floor. If there was one thing different, it was that these bags were silver-colored rather than bronze.\nThe blonde maid moved busily. Meanwhile, the eyes of the Guide landed on one man. And that was Seol, still stupidly staring at the empty air in front of his eyes.\n“Please reveal the grade of your Mark.”\nHan's voice was low, but it contained an undeniable power. Seol was too preoccupied with the whole Innate Abilities thing until then, but when the voice powerfully reverberated within his eardrums, he quickly snapped out of his daze and asked back.\n“R-Reveal my Mark's grade?”\n“Yes. Oh, it's fine now, so…. Hmm!?”\nThe Guide suddenly stopped his words and stared hard.\n“What….”\nHis eyes widened as he stared at Seol, or to be more specific, his revealed Mark's grade.\n“G-Gold!?”\nThe blonde maid, who finished distributing the bags, lightly trotted to the stage and used her elbow to gently poke the waist of the dumbstruck Guide.\n“Ah!”\nFinally regaining his senses, Han lightly coughed and cleared his throat while lowering his gaze.\nWith the remaining piece of paper in his hand, he became overtly cautious as he slowly unfolded the Invitation letter. He read the contents from top to bottom without leaving anything out. Then, he breathed out a long sigh.\n“We have a…. very important guest this time.”\nHis voice was quiet. But, still— the noisy clamor came to a dead stop, and dozens and dozens of eyes focused on one person. Seol could actively feel his cheeks reddening right about now.\n“I'd like to apologize. It is my first time guiding a Gold Mark, after all…. No, even in history, there has been only one prior event like today's. I've only heard about it until now.”\nSeol wondered if this Gold Mark thing was such a shocking matter. Han's words didn't even sound like an excuse, just some babblings of a stunned man.\nWhen the blonde maid giggled softly, Han cleared his throat again.\n“Alright, let's carry on, shall we?”\nHe lightly threw Seol's Invitation letter. The paper exploded into a brilliant shower of light before transforming into a single bag.\nAnd there were six things written on the tag of the gold bag.\nThree regular bonus items, plus three special bonus items unique to the Invited— quite unlike any other Invitation letters; Kim Hannah made sure to pack hers to the brim, it seemed.\n“For the Gold Mark…. Oh.”\nHan's jaw dropped after he read the list of bonus items."

    "content": "The Guide remained shocked for a considerable amount of time, being unable to complete his sentence. Then, his lips began twitching in an ugly manner before he hurriedly covered up his monocle with his hand. However, Seol still got to see the lens emit some sort of light before it was covered.\n“Fuck, the one who invited that man, are you watching right now?”\nThe Guide growled quite menacingly.\n“What is the meaning of this? Why is a Guide even necessary if you plan on doing things this way?”\nIt seemed that Han was really ticked off.\n“Are you making fun of me? Was your experience during the Tutorial that unpleasant? You’re trying to completely rip it to shreds, is that it? Just how did you even know what that man would need in here…..!?”\nSuddenly, the light from the lens vanished. The Guide issued a short but sharp groan and began chewing his lips.\nCompletely and utterly disregarding Han, the blonde maid simply picked up the golden bag and gracefully brought it to Seol. Han didn't try to interfere, but his complexion was visibly complicated.\nJust what was in this bag then? Seol couldn't help but become quite curious now. Even the taciturn Yun Seora craned her neck slightly to sneak a better look.\nSeol confirmed that there were six items listed on the tag attached to the bag.\n—Necessary Box, x3\n—Survival Points - 5,000 points\n—Mark of Survival, x1\n—Diary of an Unknown Student, x1\nThe first thing to attract Seol's gaze was the so-called 'Necessary Box'. He heard that both the Bronze and Silver Marks got Random Boxes. His had a different name.\n“Please, open and apply your bonuses here.”\nUnlike before, Han's voice seemed to possess far more urgency than before. Since he was planning to do that anyways, Seol slowly unlocked and opened the bag.\n[5000 Survival Points have been credited to you.]\n[You have acquired (1) Mark of Survival.]\n[The Diary of an Unknown Student is currently being updated.]\nThe smartphone buzzed and vibrated in his pocket, but Seol couldn't feel it. Why? Because, his attention had been stolen away by the three boxes with all sorts of intricate symbols and runes covering them, neatly tucked to the bottom of the bag.\n“There should be three boxes inside the bag. You can just open them. Nothing complicated to worry about.”\nHan tried to add some explanations in a friendly manner, but he failed to hide his eagerness to see what was inside those boxes.\n“Shit, all this suspense is killing me here. Hey, is it fine if we open the box together?”\nKang Seok, who had been staring at Seol's bag with barely-disguised greed, stood halfway up from his chair. It was then.\n“Sit back down.”\nA powerful but still well-mannered voice slammed into Kang Seok's eardrums.\n“No, I was just….”\n“I told you to sit back down.”\nHan's voice sounded incredibly cold. Kang Seok nervously swallowed his saliva and parked his butt back down on the chair.\nThe Guide, Han, snorted out once and then began fiddling with his monocle.\n“….His bonuses are reserved only for that person. They are things you, Mister Kang Seok, should neither see nor even desire.”\nHan then shifted his gaze back to Seol.\nThe assembly hall fell into the grips of the deathly silence yet again. Not even the sounds of breathing could be heard now.\nAs for Seol….\nEach of the boxes was no bigger than an adult's clenched fist. Pressured by the silent stares, Seol reached inside, and carefully opened the first box.\n[The Necessary Box (x1) has been opened!]\n[Scanning for the most 'needed item' during the current situation…. Please wait.]\n[The awakening of the Innate Ability, “??”, has been initiated.]\nWhen Seol blinked his eyes once, new messages began popping up one after the other.\n[Your Innate Ability, Future Vision, is responding to the awakening of the new ability!]\n[The Innate Ability, “??”, has evolved into “Nine Eyes”.]\n[The central direction (1) of your Innate Ability - Nine Eyes, the Green color: General Observation, has been fully unlocked.]\n[Please confirm your Status Window.]\n'Green color? General Observation?'\nHearing the announcement that he should check the Status Window, Seol raised his head, which led him to peek at the top of Yun Seora's craning head.\n[Yun Seora's Status Window]\n[1. General Information]\nSummoned date: March 16th, 2017Marking Grade: SilverSex/Age: Female/20Height/Weight: 166.2 cm/53.4 kgCurrent Condition: GoodClass: LV. 0 (Invited)Nationality: Republic of Korea (Area 1)Affiliation: N/AAlias: N/A\n[2.

(Possesses a smart brain as well as good overall talents)—Highly observant. (Will carefully analyze and study items and events all around her.)\nShe must have sensed his gaze. Yun Seora raised her head, and Seol almost reflexively cried out. He quickly averted his gaze, but her Status Window didn't disappear from his sight. It wasn't just her general information and her traits, either – her physical level, talents, and even her conscientious awareness were laid bare.\nNot knowing what happened, Yun Seora could only tilt her head.\nFrom Seol's perspective, this whole thing felt absurd. Didn't Han say that one's Status Window couldn't be observed by others without explicit permission from the person themself?\n[Yi Seol-Ah's Status Window]\n[1. General Information]\nSummoned date: March 16th, 2017Marking grade: BronzeSex/Age: Female/18Height/Weight: 160.6 cm/49.8 kg.Current Condition: GoodClass: LV. 0 (Invited)Nationality: Republic of Korea (Area 1)Affiliation: N/AAlias: N/A\n[2.

Aptitude:—A jack-of-all-trades. (Good at various activities.)—High-concentration. (Can use 100% of her concentration while performing an action.)\nWhen Seol sneaked a glance at Yi Seol-Ah to make sure, he also got to see her Status Window. Now feeling somewhat befuddled, Seol was about to raise his hand when he realized his mistake and quickly lowered it.\n“Yes? Are you curious about something?”\nHowever, the Guide didn't miss Seol's actions.\n“Have you opened your boxes?”\n“….Yes, I have.”\nSeol's throat suddenly dried up. He couldn't be sure why, but he thought that not saying anything right now was for the best. So, he decided to change the topic slightly.\n“I just received a message to confirm my Status Window, so….”\n“Oh, I see. Your Status Windows, is it…”\nHan's anxious expression seemed to brighten up in an instant.\n“So, what was updated? Your traits? Or perhaps, abilities?”\nWhen Seol wordlessly stared at Han, the Guide awkwardly laughed. Seeing that reaction, it wasn't all that difficult for Han to figure it out.\n“Oh, my. Please, excuse my thoughtless behaviour. You do not have to worry. As long as you don't permit it, not only me, but no one else alive in this world can take a peek at your Status Window.”\nThe Guide was inwardly breathing a sigh of relief while saying this. A Necessary Box usually gave out something outrageous to those who were privileged enough to open them. One’s traits, abilities, and even physical prowess were fair game. If Seol’s Status Window had only been updated, Han could accept it.\nOf course, that was only possible because Han had no idea just what kind of ability Seol had awakened.\nWhen the probing eyes of the Guide had left him, Seol hurriedly opened the remaining boxes — both at the same time.\n[Your Innate Ability, Nine Eyes, is evolving further.]\n[The left directions (3) of the Innate Ability ‘Nine Eyes’ have been unlocked: Yellow – 'Attention Required', Orange – 'Do Not Approach', and Red – 'Immediate Retreat Recommended'.]\n[You have acquired the 'Paper Talisman'.]\nSeol couldn't see this talisman at the moment. Because, he was far too occupied to notice it. Seol was under the belief that he could only see green until now, so the mental shock he received was similar to someone violently hitting him on the back of his head.\n….You have beautiful eyes….\n….Yes, they are beautiful. In the seven shades of the rainbow…\nSeol inexplicably remembered something from his distant past, something he had almost forgotten. The whispers of a woman he couldn't even remember the face of brushed past his brain cells like a bolt of lightning.\n'H– Hold up. Red, orange, yellow, green…..'\n“Excuse me.”\nWhile Seol was in the midst of his thoughts, someone from the right side of the assembly hall piped up with a voice smaller than a mosquito buzzing around.\nHan was still rubbing his chest while feeling rather relieved with himself. His eyes immediately shifted towards the group of the Contracted. A young woman sporting a bob-cut hair was dusting her butt while standing up.\n“Uhm, is it, possibly….”\n“What is it? We're just about ready to begin.”\nHis attitude was clearly different from when interacting with the Invited. Hearing his voice full of annoyance akin to chasing away a pesky bug, a certain sense of dissatisfaction formed on the woman's face.\n“You are not giving us anything?”\n“?”\n“You know, like those bags that those people just got.”\nThe Guide let off a cynical chuckle and then replied immediately.\n“Yes. You don't get anything.”\n“B– But why not?”\n“Those bonus items are reserved for the Invited only.”\nIt was a simple and articulate answer, but a deep frown emerged on the woman’s face.\n“Why is there a difference?”\n“It's simple.”\nThe Guide smiled softly and his right hand pointed towards his right, that is, the left side of the hall.\n“These guests have been invited here after going through a strict evaluation.”\nNext, Han's left index finger pointed to his left, the right side of the hall, in a somewhat accusatory manner.\n“And you people got dragged here because of the Contracts.”\n“No, that's not what I meant!”\n“Besides, didn't you, Miss Shin Sang-Ah, receive ample compensation back in reality? Hmm?”\nWith the timely arrival of that question, the woman with the bob-cut hair, Shin Sang-Ah, became utterly lost for words. She sat back down with a reddened face, but that wasn't the end.\n“Are you done talking?”\nA man from the group of the Contracted stood up in indignation. Seeing how fierce his eyes were, not to mention his rather well-developed physique, he looked like someone who knew how to get down and dirty if need be.\n“And what else do you want?”\nFinally, a look of irritation formed on Han's face.\n“Ah? Can't you provide a proper explanation on what this Contract bullshit is? You told us to come here and this is how you treat us?”\nA few people here and there began to quietly agree with the nameless man.\nSuch a complaint was bound to occur sooner or later. After all, ever since the Guide appeared, he paid attention only to the left side of the hall, where the Invited were.\nThey were already feeling unsure and anxious, and after being treated like a bunch of invisible fish out of water, it was not very strange to see them spit out their dissatisfaction in the open. Unfortunately for them, this wasn't the place to voice their problems, neither was Han the correct person to complain to.\n“You know what, stop wasting time and get us some chairs, too. My legs are aching from all that standing around.”\n“That's right! Now that I see, you still look like a young man, so, how can you even think that it's good to discriminate between people like this?”\nWhen more and more voices began chiming in, some amount of confidence and energy began filling up the expression of the nameless man. He glared at the Guide, waiting for a response.\nAs for Han, he was simply smirking back at them.\n“….Sometimes, we get people like you. Those who don't know their place, those who only know how to bark and nothing else.”\n“What did you say?”\n“Well, I do understand you. I don't know which deplorable bastard reeled you in, but you must have jumped in first without even waiting to listen to an explanation. That is, after being blinded by money and the promised reward.”\nThe nameless man flinched.\n“Whatever the case may be, you have already signed the Contract, haven't you? As long as you are here, you don't have a choice but to follow my guidance. If you want to complain, then you should meet up with the person you signed the Contract with later on and do so.”\n“So, what you're saying is I should sit here quietly?”\n“Exactly.”\n“We don't deserve to know so we better shut up and do as told?”\n“Correct. Excellent analysis.”\n“Ha, what should I do, then? Because I don't feel like doing that.”\n“Well, if you feel that way.”\nSeeing the nameless man's rebellious attitude, Han simply pointed at the lone exit of the assembly hall with his index finger.\n“You can simply leave.”\n“You stinking son of a bitch. You think I won't leave?”\nThe nameless man venomously shot back and turned to address the group, shouting out loudly at them.\n“He's telling us to leave, so let's leave then! Tell them to do whatever the hell they want and let's go!”\nHearing this, three or four stood up hesitatingly. Ultimately, though, the number of those preparing to move was small.\n“What are you all doing? I'm saying, we should leave, now!”\nEven after the nameless man urged the crowd, no one else budged. And when the majority didn't move, even those who did stand up began sitting back down. Sure, there was the awkward atmosphere to consider, but also, it wasn't as if every Contracted here didn't receive an explanation or two before coming here.\n“Hah, screw this. What a bunch of dumb cowards.”\nThe nameless man muttered a few choice words, and then angrily stomped his way towards the exit. The blonde maid with her quick wits was already there; she carefully creaked the door open. The man turned around, spat on the floor of the assembly hall, and made his exit.\n“Is there anyone else who wishes to leave?”\nThe Guide asked, but no one else made a move. The maid silently closed the door and locked it.\nHan didn't say anything else. He simply stared at the door with an expression of someone finding it all rather amusing. As this strange silence continued, the crowd alternated their gazes between the exit and the Guide for a while.\nAnd so… a minute went by like that. And just as the second minute was about to tick by….\nThey all could hear the hurried and scared running steps approaching the door. Then, the door handle was desperately yanked from the outside.\n—Open the door!! Open the door!!\nNext, there was heavy pounding on the door….\n—You fucking sons of bitches! Open! Please!! Pleeeeaaaase!!! Ah, aaaaaahhhh!!!”\nThe noises from the outside suddenly cut off — both the screams of that nameless man and the pounding on the door.\n“Well, I knew that would happen. Alright, in any case, let's all get started. The time's already this late and all.”\nThe Guide smiled brightly and tapped an icon on his smartphone.\n[You have received a new message from the Guide.]\n[The Tutorial's first mission, 'Escape from the Assembly Hall', will now commence!]\n[The Diary of an Unknown Student has been updated.]\n“I pray for an enjoyable school life for all of you.”\nHan placed his right hand across his chest and politely bowed. Then….\n“Everyone, I wish you all a good fortune.”\n….He vanished into thin air, just like when he made his first appearance. Not just him, but the blonde maid as well.\nNow left seemingly abandoned, people began standing up in haste, one by one.\nJust as someone was about to shout out…\nKWANG!!\nAn impact noise on a different scale from the previous pounding rocked the exit door, instantly silencing the uproar before it could even start.\nOne of the door's hinges couldn't endure the impact and broke off from the wall, hitting the ground with a sharp metallic clang. The door had been securely locked up, yet it was forced open just a crack before it was closed shut again.\nThe silence that settled within this confusion was deafening.\nNone of them knew what to do next. Only the instinctive reaction of the mouths silently bobbing up and down continued.\n“….”\nOf course, Seol didn't remain still as this chaos unfolded. He picked up the empty golden bag, slung it over his shoulder, and got up from his chair. All the meanwhile, he didn't forget to keep his eyes on the door.\nBecause the door was no longer shining in green but in the color of orange."

    "content": "[Sender: The Guide][1. Escape from the assembly hall and arrive at the second floor waiting area of the main school building before the time runs out.][2. Remaining time: 03:59:38]\nKWANG!!\nThe door seemed to almost break as the fierce pounding continued, and it issued a harsh metallic protest. No, it was better to describe that the door would break, very soon.\nKWANG, KWANG!!\nEven seeing with naked eyes, it was difficult to believe that this was really happening; the thick metal door was struck only twice, yet it caved in as if it was made up of paper. Several thick metal hinges were hanging dangerously loose, ready to fall at the slightest impact.\n“W– we need to block that!!”\nRather than shouting, it was more like everyone fell into a frenzy.\nThe movements of humans when their lives were under threat were remarkably swift. Yi Seol-Ah picking up her chair and running towards the door signaled the beginning; dozens of bodies all rushed to the door.\nSomeone brought along unoccupied chairs, someone climbed up the stage to see if there was anything useful up there, while the rest simply used their bodies to push against the door.\n“Kkheuk!”\nThe noisy, consecutive pounding on the door seemed to contain a certain amount of anger, and the force from the resulting impact managed to knock four, five guys away as if they weighed nothing.\n“Move out of the way!”\nJust in time, a group had brought down the pulpit from the stage and jammed it against the door. Although that alone wouldn't be enough to completely block the door, it was still better than nothing.\nChairs got piled up alongside the pulpit in the blink of an eye. On top of that, twenty-odd men propped the door up with everything they had. Soon, the door no longer looked like it'd break down. And, after a man placed a chair below the door handle like an improvised doorstop, the crowd began sighing out in genuine relief.\n“Haa…”\nYi Seol-Ah stopped propping the door with her back and squatted down on the floor as if she was feeling dizzy.\nPerhaps the sight of a young frail girl fighting desperately looked pitiful to him, as a middle-aged man spoke to her while wiping the sweat off his brows.\n“You’re very quick-witted for someone who is so young.”\nHe was speaking about her making the move first. People who acted after she had made hers nodded their heads in agreement. If it weren't for Yi Seol-Ah's quick actions, the door might have broken down by now.\nYi Seol-Ah didn't know how to respond and shyly lowered her gaze.\n“No, it wasn't like that….”\n“I froze up from the fear myself. But boy, was I shocked or what watching you react like that. When I realized, heh, I was also moving, you see.”\n“Everyone did their best to help. I wouldn't have been able to block the doorway by myself.”\nYi Seol-Ah's embarrassed appearance helped to alleviate some of the tense atmosphere permeating within the assembly hall. Her gentle personality really did suit that bright and pretty appearance perfectly. Also, the fact that she was an Invited, as well as the first person to respond, were enough for the group to develop a favorable impression towards her.\nUnfortunately, the event that happened just now was far too shocking to instill a warm and cordial atmosphere.\n“So, what should we do next, then?”\nSomeone's resigned sigh-like muttering brought everyone back to reality. Some turned their expectant eyes towards Yi Seol-Ah's direction, but even she was at a loss.\nSoon, the collective gazes of the Contracted were focusing on the Invited.\nOnce the chaos had died down, Seol turned his attention back to his phone. Besides the message from the Guide, he had received two more. One of them happened to be the 'diary of an unknown student', his so-called bonus item.\n[Sender: Unknown]\n[#Assembly Hall (an excerpt from the Diary of an Unknown Student, page 2.)]\n….There was only one door in and out of the assembly hall. We did somehow block it up, but at the same time, we also ended up blocking our only way out.\nBefore long, the outside became quiet.\nSadly, my classmates were divided into two groups.\nOne group wanted to wait and see for a while longer, while the other group wanted to go outside to take a look…\nBy the time the infighting became heated, we forgot about the existence outside the walls.\n….Soon, we all got to learn that ‘that thing' was not a simple monster or a zombie.\n[#Assembly Hall (an excerpt from the Diary of an Unknown Student, page 3)]\nIt was a total pandemonium. No other words could describe it.\nThe door we had desperately blocked became useless.\n….During the chaos, I was able to somehow discover the 'hole'.\n'Hole?'\nSeol was paying attention to the last line. But by the time he raised his head, the group of Contracted had somehow inched closer to his general location, almost managing to surround him.\n“Wowsers. It's just the beginning, yet they aren't messing around. Look at the goosebumps on my arms!”\nKang Seok was busy rubbing his arm, but he seemed to have more than enough leeway as he spoke those words.\n“Now that the door is all blocked up, I wonder what we should do next….”\nHis words and attitude raised hopes in the hearts of the Contracted that a quick solution to their problems would be found soon. However….\n“Let's go. Let's just poke around here and there, see what's what.”\nKang Seok only took his lackeys, Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo, along with him, prompting those waiting for an answer to their prayers to be dumbstruck instead.\nThe bespectacled middle-aged man wearing a worn-out business suit — the man who praised Yi Seol-Ah earlier — hurriedly stepped in front of them.\n“E– excuse me.”\n“Hey, Hyungsik, check out the back of the stage. And Minwoo, you should….”\n“Excuse me, young man!”\n“….What, me?”\nKang Seok's reply arrived some breaths later.\nThe middle-aged man couldn't be sure if he made a mistake or not, but he felt that Kang Seok did that deliberately.\n“What are you all trying to do?”\n“Uh…. Searching around the assembly hall?”\n“Around the assembly hall?”\n“Yeah. Like those guys.”\nKang Seok pointed towards the stage, where Yun Seora and the man named Hyun Sangmin — the man with the green baseball cap — were busy searching around, their heads turning this way and that while doing so.\n“To find what, exactly?”\n“Not really sure. Now that the exit is all blocked up, I guess we gotta find something, right? We don't know what might happen next, anyways.”\n“Right, right. That's right. Of course.”\nThe middle-aged man nodded his head quite enthusiastically, necessitating him to catch the falling glasses and put it back on his nose.\n“So, you want us to help as well?”\n“Eh?”\nKang Seok frowned slightly.\n“Why are you…. Do what you want, mister. It's not like I'm the boss here or anything.”\n“That's true. But, you guys, well, how should I say this… Hmm. You guys are different from us, isn't that right?”\n“Sure, we're different. So, what is it that you want to say?”\nThe tone of Kang Seok's voice remained curt. He even sounded quite similar to how the Guide sounded when talking to the Contracted.\n“What I'm trying to say here is, we should help each other out. That’s all.”\nThe middle-aged man ignored the hostile tone and pleaded his case, but all he got back instead, was a dismissive chuckle.\n“I'll have to politely decline. It'll get very annoying with more people clinging on us, so I don't want to.”\n“What do you mean, annoying?”\n“Whatever. You take care of your own business, okay? The three of us, we will go our own way.”\nKang Seok refused the middle-aged man's offer without hesitation and turned around to leave. The middle-aged man shouted out, “Hey, wait a minute, young man!”, but Kang Seok didn't bother and kept on walking away.\n“What a petty bastard.”\nKang Seok's steps came to an abrupt halt. He stared at the ceiling for a moment or two, spat out a long sigh, and turned his head to look at the source of that name-calling.\nHe found a woman sitting with her knees tucked under her staring at him with venomous eyes. It was Shin Sang-Ah.\n“What did you call me?”\n“You're a selfish bastard. You only care about your own neck.”\n“What the hell…. Hey, you're wrong about that, though? I care about these two fellas too, you know?”\nKang Seok wrapped his arms around the shoulders of his lackeys as an oily smile formed on his lips. Shin Sang-Ah's eyes became even more hostile.\n“Oww, man. Look at how she glares! You might kill someone with such eyes, lady.”\n“Hey, isn't she that dumb woman who threw a tantrum just now? You know, asking for a bag of her own and shit.”\nYi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo giggled hoarsely at her expense. Didn't the old saying go along the line of 'the sister-in-law trying to stop the mother-in-law is more hateful than the mother-in-law beating you up'?\n“Can't you see these people over here? There are women and children here!”\n“I can see just fine. I've got good eyes, you know.”\nShin Sang-Ah shouted at him in anger, but Kang Seok didn't even bat an eye.\n“And, and you three…. just want to survive all by yourselves?”\n“What do you expect us to do when we're also in a hurry?”\n“That's why we said we'd help, didn't we!?”\n“God, how can you be this dense? Hey, listen up. We don't need your measly help nor do we want it in the first place. Stop trying to lump us with useless baggage like you.”\n“Useless baggage!?”\n“Yep. You are nothing more than baggage. Even a blind fool can see that you're trying to leech off of us. So, shoo, shoo. Go away.”\nShin Sang-Ah became flabbergasted and her mouth gradually opened up in disbelief.\n“You three…. are you even human beings?”\n“Oh? Maybe you're all parasites, then?”\nKang Seok sarcastically retorted right until the end. Shin Sang-Ah couldn't hold her anger anymore and stood right up, getting ready to slap him. Kang Seok snorted derisively and retracted his arms from the shoulders of his lackeys.\nAnd just as the volatile situation was about to blow up, a young girl hurriedly jumped in between the two parties and intervened. It was none other than Yi Seol-Ah.\n“Please, both of you, stop!”\nShin Sang-Ah opened her mouth to say something, but must have thought that it was unwise because she simply turned her head away instead, and said nothing. But her clenched fists were trembling in rage. Meanwhile, Kang Seok simply shook his head in derision.\n“It's barely enough to get through this even when we're working together, yet why are you two fighting like this?”\n“Working together, my ass.”\nKang Seok shot back with a shout.\n“We three, we go way back. Even before we got here, you know? That's why we came here with a plan of our own.”\n“But!”\n“But, but, but. Kiss my butt, instead. Hey, you're also an Invited, so you should've realized it by now, too.”\nKang Seok smirked and offered his hand to Yi Seol-Ah.\n“Let's stop bickering over this, okay? Seol-Ah, why don't you join up with us? Your brother's Sungjin, right? I'll take him under my wings, too.”\n“….Why are you willing to let us tag along with your group?”\n“That's obvious, isn't it? Unlike them, you two are going to be very helpful for us.”\n“You're a very callous person, aren't you?”\nYi Seol-Ah's expression showed how disappointed she was, while her words slowly but powerlessly leaked out of her mouth.\n“I thought you were a good person, too….”\nKang Seok shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly and raised his hand up high.\n“Hey, man! What about you?”\nThe ‘you’ he was referring to was a certain youth standing there minding his own business a short distance away from them— Seol.\n“Don't you want to get this stupid Tutorial over and done with as soon as possible? I'm sure we'll finish up real fast if you join us.”\nAlthough the whole situation had turned out into a strange farce, it really didn't matter in the end. Right now, even an idiot could figure out Seol's unknown worth.\nAfter all, he was someone not even the Guide couldn't talk down to. He was, in other words, someone special.\n“Please, help us!”\nEven Yi Seol-Ah pleaded with him.\n“Please, help these people! Don't abandon them, please!”\nSeol couldn't help but feel like he was stuck in a rock and a hard place, what with being singled out like this.\nOn one side, Kang Seok and on the other, Yi Seol-Ah.\nAnd on one side, the Invited, and the other, the Contracted.\nOne side talked about the reality of the situation, while the other tried to appeal to his emotions.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, when faced with such a choice, Seol instinctively activated his ability. The entirety of the assembly hall was bathed in a cacophony of colors.\n'What the…?'\nFor a moment there, Seol mistakenly thought that he was sinking into a sea of blood.\nAnd no, it turned out that he didn't make a mistake.\nThe colors of the blocked-up exit had changed from orange to green; instead, it was Kang Seok who was shining in orange now. There was no color shining from Yi Seol-Ah at the same time.\nHowever, Seol couldn't afford to mind these changes in color at this moment. Why?\nBecause, the entire floor was dyed in the deep shade of red, that was why. It was as if he was looking at a sea of blood.\n'…Immediate retreat recommended, wasn't it?'\n….Just as Seol thought this, a loud alarm bell went off inside his head.\nBump!\nSuddenly, the wooden floor of the assembly hall quaked upwards. The aged wooden floorboards began tearing up, pieces violently flying off one by one. People had to perform unsteady dances while trying to regain their lost balance as the floor rumbled.\n“W– what the hell!?”\n“An earthquake?”\nThat line of thought proved to be far too lackadaisical for the current situation.\nIt happened in the blink of an eye.\nThe floor exploded as if a bomb had gone off. And from between the gaps of flying bits of wood, a lengthy and rotting arm shot out. There were six hook-like things attached to the end of this arm.\nThe arm drew a short but sharp arc in the air and came down to the floor, before grabbing the hair of the totally dazed and stiffly standing Yi Seol-Ah, proceeding to drag her down the newly-created hole.\n“Kyaaaak!!”\nYi Seol-Ah’s head slammed into the floorboard with vengeance and bounced up, and like a golf ball rolling towards the flag hole, she got rapidly sucked into the gaping black hole on the wooden floor.\n“Noonaaaa!!!”\nYi Sungjin pounced on the upside-down pair of legs kicking helplessly in the air.\n“Heeeeelp!!”\nThat cry sobered up everyone right away, and the crowd rushed in to grab hold of Yi Sungjin, as he too was getting dragged into the hole as well. As the ten-odd pairs of hands tugged and pulled and yanked, shoes flew away, and then, even loose socks came flying.\nAmongst the hectic chaos, somehow some people managed to grab Yi Seol-Ah's flailing legs and ankles, and from there, a desperate tug of war unfolded.\n“Hold on!! Don't let go!”\n“Pull up!! I said, pull them up!!”\nThe whole place descended into pure, unbridled chaos. Cries and shouts were roared out; no one dared to hold back as they struggled hard.\nEven with the combined strength of ten plus men, Yi Seol-Ah couldn't be pulled out of the hole. They were being roughly rocked from side to side due to the sheer force pulling down from below, causing many to lose their grips and crash to the floor.\n“Euahahah!”\n“Hey! Don't let go!”\nIt was then.\nKYAAAAAAAK!\nThe scream was definitely from Yi Seol-Ah, yet the horrifying screeching tone made it seemingly impossible for a human to issue such a sound.\nSplash!\nAnd from the hole, red liquid exploded upwards. It was like seeing a blender stuffed full of tomatoes switching on but with its lid not closed, and then, crushed bits of flesh and juice were flying off everywhere.\nThe crimson blood rained down like a small fountain.\n“Noona!! Noonaaaa!!”\nHer legs that were kicking and twisting until now, suddenly went dead straight and still. All of her ten toes curled up simultaneously; her thighs trembled; and then, just like a puppet with its strings cut, her knees folded. A certain sickening sensation of something being cut was transmitted to the hands of everyone trying to pull her back out.\nThe pulling force from below was suddenly gone. Everyone fell back hard on their rear ends with loud thuds.\nAmong them, a man was rubbing his aching butt. And while frowning, he took a look at his hands.\nHe was still holding onto a slender ankle. Below that, a smooth, rather shapely leg. Even further below, a blue skirt soaked in blood.\nBeyond that…. he couldn't see any other connecting body parts. All he could see was some remains of crushed intestines and bits of mangled flesh.\n“Aaa…..”\nHe saw the shape of something human slowly rising up from the hole in the floorboards.\n“Aaah….”\nIts long, unkempt hair seemed to dance around unrestrained, caked with blood and bits of human flesh from top to bottom.\n“Aaah, ah…..”\nIts head was at least four times the size of a grown adult man's head. And there was a single giant eye that took up almost half of that large head.\n“Ah, ah, ahhhhaaaack!!”\nThe man couldn't hold it back any longer and screamed. He got up as quickly as he could and ran for his life. He didn't know where to, but as long as he could get as far away from that creature as humanly possible, he'd be fine with that.\nSoon, pure chaos descended on the assembly hall. There was no other fitting description. People got utterly, completely terrified by the creature's grotesque appearance, and while screaming their heads off, they scattered everywhere.\n'….My, my thoughts are….' \nWhen Seol regained his own wits, he found himself running towards the blocked up door.\n'Why….'\nIt should be normal to hear all that crazy chaos unfolding all around him, yet, the noise got progressively less and less prominent, fading into nothingness. Everything seemed to crawl down to slow motion as well.\nEverything, even the man busy pulling and chucking away the chairs blocking the exit; even the nightmarish creature that had fully revealed itself from the hole, extending its long limbs like a spider and starting its assault on the fleeing crowd….\nEvery one of these little things, they were unfolding in slow motion for him to watch without missing anything.\n'Why….'\nHe found it very difficult to breathe. Sweat drops falling on his eyes spread out like paint and blurred his vision.\n'Why….'\nHow many would die here today? The footing was already slippery from the blood. And it had also gotten sticky.\nHis body became heavier and his running speed gradually slowed down. He even had to wonder if he was aimlessly flailing his arms and legs here. Everything was in a total mess.\nIn the end, Seol stopped running and stood still, even though the exit was only a few steps away.\nSuddenly, the stuffed up breath exploded out. He could hear his own escaping breath; the cold wind blowing in from the now-wide open exit caused his own boiling, seething body to relax. His heart continued to pound away in his chest.\nSeol was well aware how stupid and dangerous it was to ignore the warnings of immediate retreat. It wasn't too late to run away, even now. Yet….\n'Why… am I so calm?'\nThe acrid air stung his nose, his body was burning up, and he felt dizzy. And then, the familiar sensation of vertigo assaulting him went away.\nThe dreamy haziness dissipated almost immediately, and the surrounding world became clear again. Seol slowly closed his eyes.\nThe monster was busy feasting on a corpse, but it stopped and abruptly turned its head around. It spun around in a manner akin to the second hand of a clock and found a single man standing near the exit of the hall. It ran towards the man on all fours.\nKheehick?\nSeeing that the man wasn’t budging an inch, it tilted its head in confusion and craned its neck. And like how a person might appraise a plate of food before eating it, the monster studied Seol with great interest.\nThe foreign, unknown matter brushed by his cheeks and the disgusting odor assaulted his senses.\nIt was a rather familiar feeling and a welcoming smell.\nHis sensory perception became incredibly sharp. Seol's closed eyes cracked open a sliver. In front of his nose, a huge black vertical slit of a pupil, with bloodshot whites surrounding it was waiting.\nAnd when his gaze met with that eye brimming full with the desire to kill….\n“……..”\nA relaxed smile broke out on Seol's lips.\nKeeeick!\nThe monster hurriedly retracted its neck.\nHis eyes still narrowed to a slit, he lightly kicked up the broken leg of the chair lying near the exit.\nWhether to confront it or to show his back to it; he already had his answer; the Seol of the dream told him.\nHe told Seol that a creature like this, it was nothing to him. He even asked Seol, you’ve overcome even more dangerous situations than this, haven't you?\n….Even the Seol from before the gambling, before he had lost his ability, said the same thing; now was the time to bet everything.\nHe snatched the leg of the chair spinning in the air. For some reason, it just felt right in his grasp.\nAnd, even though it wasn't a spear, he still held it like one and got into a stance.\nAnd shortly after that, both of his eyes widened."

    "content": "Just as Seol took a step forward while pointing the sharp, broken edge of the chair leg at the monster…\nKiiiiik!\nIt flinched and cowered. The monster quickly retracted its head and pressed its crawling body flat to the ground. And when his airborne first step finally came down to the floor, it retreated in a flash, its reaction speed as quick as a boar that got stung by a scorching skewer.\nThe sneakily retreating monster looked very confused as if it couldn't quite figure out why it was running away like this.\nGrrrr….\nWhen the monster accepted the fact that it was getting suppressed by Seol's aura, its phlegm gurgled loudly in its throat. Its instincts were screaming out danger warnings.\nThis human in front of its eyes was incomparable to everyone else. If it attacked this man, then it would die.\nThe monster had already filled its belly to some extent. Also, there were lots of other prey running loose outside. There was no reason for the monster to brave this danger in here.\nAs soon as the monster made this decision, it rapidly escaped through the open door. Truly, it possessed quick wits and just as quick reflexes.\nTk.\nThe broken leg of the chair slipped out of Seol's hand and fell. Seol looked around the assembly hall's empty interior with a somewhat dazed face. He looked totally deflated right now.\nNot a long time had passed, yet he could spot well over ten corpses lying in a pool of blood. Eventually, the hole that the monster crawled out from caught his attention.\n'It's the hole from the diary.'\nSo, that was it then. The hole from the diary was that one.\nSeol took another glance at the hall's exit. There was some hesitation, but he still chose to cross the floor and cautiously peered over the edge, now dripping wet with blood. Then, he carefully lowered himself inside.\n[The Diary of an Unknown Student has been updated.]\nSeol arrived at the basement floor. He decided to walk forward, at least for the time being. He must have overused his powers a bit as his mind and body felt quite fatigued.\nThe corridor bent 90 degrees up front, and he eventually arrived at the part where it was lined with doors set at a regular interval on either side. It seemed that the school had used this underground floor as the space for club meetings and activities. Seol pushed open the door with a colorful banner proclaiming “Go, anywhere!”\nThe room beyond was small and intimate, only about ten or fifteen square meters wide. Checking the posters hanging on the walls, it seemed that this room belonged to a travel club.\nSeol lowered the golden bag from his shoulder and sat down against the wall.\nAs he sat there like a man in a trance, his once-hazy consciousness seemed to return to him bit by bit. It was as if he was waking up from a long dream.\nAnd, soon enough….\n'What was I even thinking…?'\nThe previously forgotten terror and disgust came crashing in one after the other. The smell of blood that he had blocked out of his mind with the help from the adrenaline rush caused him to gag out reflexively. When he recalled the appearance of the so-called weakling monster, his entire body began to shiver in fear.\nHowever, all of this only lasted for a short moment. When he slowly gathered his breath, the shivering and the shaking came to a stop. Feeling his heart settle down, Seol couldn't help but form a wry smile.\nWas the demonic destroyer Seol of the dream the real him? Or was the man shivering in fear right now the real him?\nIt all felt like he was experiencing Zhuangzi's ‘Butterfly Dream’. [1]\nSeol gritted his teeth and focused his mind, trying to organize what had happened so far.\nThe first thing to figure out was the question regarding his eyes.\nThe evolved ability called 'Nine Eyes'…. This managed to give Seol quite a bit of mental shock. After all, he had been living under the assumption that seeing the green color was all his eyes were capable of.\n'No, it wasn't that there were no other colors, I just couldn't see them.'\nThe newly-unlocked colors were yellow, orange, and red. Just as important, there were other colors yet to be unlocked.\nKang Seok was shown in yellow color, the so-called 'Attention Required'; yet there was no color for Yi Seol-Ah. That meant he couldn't see her color yet.\nThinking about that girl, his thoughts became rather complicated. Her pleading shouts for help still rang around in his head. If he hadn’t taken his time making up his mind, could that good-hearted girl still be alive by now?\n[Mister Kang Seok, Mister Yi Hyungsik, and Mister Jeong Minwoo have arrived at the second-floor waiting area.]\n'They got there already?'\nThe sudden announcement helped clear out Seol's mind somewhat.\n[#Basement first floor, the club room (excerpt from the Diary of an Unknown Student, page 5)]\nI've somehow managed to hide in the basement, but tears keep pouring out of my eyes. I can't stop crying.\nI can't forget the screams of my friends dying right in front of me.\nWhat kind of a monster was that? And why…. Oh, God. Please, help me….\nI cried for so long. Eventually, my stomach grumbled in hunger.\nI knew this wasn't the right time nor the place, but still, I'm so hungry….\nSeol read the diary carefully before discovering that there was a file attached to it as well. He must have missed it before as things had been quite hectic. When he clicked on the file and opened it, Seol's eyes widened in surprise.\n'A map?'\nThe attached file was actually the blueprint-like map of the entire school grounds. When he clicked on the 'main building', that portion of the map expanded in size and Seol could easily check out the building's interior layout.\nHis gaze fell on a spot by the second floor. This particular room was in a rectangular shape, and there were six blue blinking icons located on, or near the edges and lines demarcating the walls. However, he saw one of them change to red color, before ceasing to blink altogether.\nKnock. Knock.\nSeol was trying to figure out what those blue blinking icons could mean when he heard the sounds of knocking on the door. Surprised, Seol turned around to look and found the door briefly being bathed in a green hue before the color vanished completely.\n—…He's not in here either?\n“Who's there?”\nSeol's sharp voice stopped the noise on the outside from moving away.\n—Whew, I finally found you. Hey man, can I come inside? Oh, right. I'm not trying to threaten you or anything, so please, relax.\n“….”\n—If you don't feel comfortable with me joining you, just say so. I will leave you alone in peace.\n“….Come in.”\nThe door slowly creaked open.\n“Thanks! I was actually worried that you'd tell me to scram or something.”\nThe man entering the club room while speaking in a jovial tone was one of the eight Invited people— the one who wore a green baseball cap over his slightly long hair; his softly tanned complexion was slightly covered by a pair of sunglasses.\n“Man, I had to work hard just to find you. I mean, the bloody footsteps were getting faint, and there were so many of these rooms here too…. Oh, right. You also want a smoke?”\nThe man put his bag down on the floor and raised a small fuss, before suddenly presenting Seol with a packet of cigarettes. Wordlessly, Seol fished out his own packet. He still had one cigarette left.\n“You smoke a hybrid? I don't like them. I hate those weird flavors, man.”\nHe then proceeded to light Seol's cigarette. Soon enough, the two men were staring at each other while blue smoke lazily drifted in between them.\nThe man slowly opened his mouth.\n“Should we introduce each other? I’m Hyun Sangmin.”\n“…Seol.”\n“Seol? Kind of a girly name, don't you think? Is it a single-syllable name?”\n“How did you find me?”\nSeol changed the topic. Hyun Sangmin didn't seem to mind. He simply flicked the fingers holding the cigarette.\n“I saw you at the assembly hall, entering the hole in the floor.”\n“You remained in the hall, too?”\n“No, no. I also ran for the exit, you see. But I came back…. Huh, you were in there the whole time?”\nSeol nodded his head silently. Seeing this reply, Hyun Sangmin simply scratched his head. He then quickly continued on with his explanation.\nAt the critical juncture between life and death, the crowd was able to remove the pulpit and the piled-up chairs to yank open the exit door. The escaping people then scattered everywhere. Some headed off towards the front gate of the school, but the majority followed Kang Seok and ran to the front entrance of the main school building.\nHowever, they encountered a new problem: the entrance was locked.\n“It wasn't like we didn't have any time on our hands, though. You see, that monster looked like it would chase us down right away, but for some reason, it didn't.”\nHyun Sangmin took a look at Seol for a short while and then carried on.\n“But, no matter what we did, kicking, pushing, shoving…. Whatever the fuck we did, the door didn't budge. And we were getting all damn anxious and everything. And to make matters worse, the monster showed up as well. I'm telling you, it was no damn joke back then.”\n“So, what happened?”\n“Dunno. I was trying to pick up a rock or something in the nearby flower garden to crack the windows open, but when I saw the monster, I took off, man. I took the long way around and came back to the assembly hall.”\nHyun Sangmin lowered his sunglasses and smirked slightly.\n“Since it attacked there once already, I figured it wouldn't show up there again.”\n“And you happened to see me, and then decided to follow me?”\n“Yep. Never in my wildest imagination did I think you'd enter the hole. I was understandably hesitating on what to do. But, when I got down there, you were long gone. So, I've been looking for you until now.”\n“Why?”\n“What? You really don’t know?”\nHyun Sangmin prattled on. Of course, Seol too could more or less figure out the reason.\n“It's simple, really. I want to join you. That's why I searched for you…. So? What do you think? You want to ride alone or with me in tow?”\n“….”\n“If you are willing to let others tag along, well, how about me? But, I'm telling you this right now, I'm not planning to leech off you or anything like that.”\nWhen Seol remained silent, Hyun Sangmin became more anxious than before.\n“Alright, let me say this out loud. I can endure unfairness, but I can’t stand losing out.”\nSeol stared back somewhat confused by this statement. Hyun Sangmin killed off his cigarette and sat up straight.\n“Listen, man. What I'm proposing here isn't an equal partnership. No, it's more like a vertical relationship.”\n“A vertical relationship?”\n“That's right. You let me tag along, then I'm gonna carry out your orders. And yeah, I'm willing to take on some amount of danger for you if you ask me to.”\nHyun Sangmin's proposal was simple and easy enough to understand.\n'It's fine to use me.'\n'I'm a pretty useful guy, so believe me and utilize me.'\nSeol could just about understand why this man was willing to go this far, in this manner.\nIt was all because of Seol's Gold Mark. There was also the possibility that Hyun Sangmin had figured something out back in the assembly hall.\nHowever, Hyun Sangmin wasn't a selfless good samaritan. Obviously, he would want something in return.\n“What do you want in return?”\n“Well, lots of things, but…. For now, surviving and making my way to Paradise. That should suffice.”\nSeol studied Hyun Sangmin for a while.\n“If you're a lone wolf, I will respect that. I also don't want to force the issue. I told you this before, didn't I? You don't want me, then I'll quietly go away.”\nHe spoke up to here and slowly offered his hand.\n[Hyun Sangmin's Status]\n[1. General Information]\nSummoned date: March 16th, 2017 Marking grade: Bronze Sex/Age: Male/26 Height/Weight: 176.2 cm/65.8 kg Current condition: Healthy Class: LV. 0 (Invited) Nationality: Republic of Korea (Area 1) Affiliation: N/A Alias: N/A\n[2. Traits] 1. Temperament:—Self-centered (Only seeks out benefits for himself)\n2. Aptitude: —Extraordinary (Far more excellent than average) —Discerning eye (Possesses great instincts at determining the value of objects and people)  \nTo be perfectly honest, Seol wasn't feeling “it”. If it was someone like Yi Seol-Ah, then he wouldn't even hesitate and say yes in a heartbeat, but for Hyun Sangmin… well, nothing really seemed to pull Seol's attention.\nHowever, there was one point about Hyun Sangmin that was rather similar to that now-deceased girl.\n'I can't see his color.'\nIf his color was yellow— ‘Attention Required’— then Seol would have refused right away. But the fact that he was not able to see Hyun Sangmin's color really played on Seol's mind.\nThinking to himself that it wouldn't be so bad to wait and see, Seol grasped Hyun Sangmin’s offered hand and shook it.\n“Nice!”\nHyun Sangmin smiled brightly as if he was genuinely happy.\n“Nice, very nice! Now, I'm also a member of the best team in the world!”\nIf left alone for any longer, he might have broken out in a song and a dance. Hyun Sangmin eventually stopped making a fuss and got closer to Seol.\n“So, what are you going to do now? Mind telling me what your plans are?”\nSeol fell into deep contemplation. Since he possessed a map, going to the second floor waiting area would be a walk in the park if he decided to head there right away. Although that monster was still roaming around, as long as he used his ability, they would be able to avoid any danger.\nOut of the blue, Seol recalled Kim Hannah’s words and nearly burst out in a fit of laughter. She was right. She indeed made it so much easier for him already, so he'd better survive this event or else.\nSeol grabbed his bag as he stood up. Hyun Sangmin stared at him without saying anything.\n“For now, let's get out of here.”\n*\nThe two of them left the club room and continued down the long corridor. The door at the end of the corridor led to the underground parking lot. Of course, they couldn't spot a single parked car there.\nWhile they crossed the parking lot, Hyun Sangmin continued to yap on and on. He asked about what Seol got from his box, he got 500 survival points or something, he had no idea where to even spend that so it must have been garbage, etc, etc.\nMeanwhile, Seol walked forward while checking the map every now and then.\nWhen Seol didn't even reply once, Hyun Sangmin became somewhat embarrassed and hurriedly cleared his throat.\n“So, where are we going? Are you looking for a staircase?”\n“No.”\n“Eh? Aren't we supposed to go to the second floor?”\n“Sure, we are.”\nSeol shook his head while looking at his phone's screen.\n“However, there's no need for us to go there right away.”\n“How come? Isn't it better to get there as soon as possible?”\n“As soon as possible? Were we told anything regarding the order of arrival dictating things?”\n“That is…..”\nThat was a no. The message simply stated that they had to arrive at the destination before the time ran out. And they had over three hours and thirty minutes remaining.\nSeeing Hyun Sangmin continuously blink his eyes in confusion, Seol felt a need to explain himself a bit more.\n“Think about it. How long do you think you will need to get to the second floor waiting area from the assembly hall?”\n“Dunno. If you ran with everything you had…. less than a minute, maybe?”\n“That's correct. This school's assembly hall is constructed pretty close to the main building.”\nThe objective of the mission was far too easy. Even a normal, unprepared person would be able to clear it.\n“Don't you think that's a little strange? Even if you were delayed, the whole trip wouldn't have taken more than five minutes.”\n“Isn't it because the door was locked?”\n“A locked door could be broken into, and that would be it. And you heard that announcement from before, right? Those three must've succeeded somehow. In other words, clearing this mission wouldn't take that long of a time.”\n“Then what about the monster?”\n“Even if you consider that variable, you wouldn't need more than one hour. Two hours, tops. Four hours for a minute's worth of distance is just too much.”\nDidn't the Guide Han say something similar before, too?\n….It's not like it’s hard to get here….\nHe did say that. Truthfully, ten minutes were more than enough for Seol to find and arrive at the assembly hall. In the end, Seol only needed around four minutes to make his entrance, so it was as if he was given twice the amount of time he might need in order to accomplish his task.\nSo, what Seol found odd was that the distance he needed to cover got shortened, yet the time limit grew by several folds. There had to be a reason for that— a reason for a four-hour-long time limit.\nHyun Sangmin wasn't a fool, either. As if he too had realized something, he stopped talking and began rubbing his chin.\n“So, what you're saying is, although the mission itself is simple and easy, we have been given way too much time…. Is that right?”\n“Also, we've been told that this is just the first mission. Which means, there will be a second mission, a third mission, so on and so forth. And….”\nAlso, the fact that they were told to gather on the second floor and not anywhere higher…. As they walked, Seol added more of his thoughts.\n“In any case, the main point is, there isn't a real need to get there as soon as possible. It'll be fine for us to get there after procuring what we might need later on. There are multiple ways to get to the second floor, as well.”\n“And how do you know that?”\nSeol showed him the phone's screen. Hyun Sangmin came closer to take a look and spat out a loud snort.\n“What the… isn't this a map? But, I didn't receive one, though?”\n“I got it as my bonus. Okay, this is where we are going.”\nSeol tapped on the screen, and the map of the basement floor expanded.\n“This underground level is connected to the entire school premise. Below the assembly hall, there are the clubrooms. After we cross this parking lot, we will arrive at the main building's basement.”\nSeol soon stopped his steps. He then proceeded to open a glass door, which led the two to see what lay beyond. Hyun Sangmin couldn't help but shout out in glee.\nThey saw a long and straight corridor. To the left, there was a staircase going up, while on the right, three doors labeled 'Library', 'Convenience Store', and 'Stationery'.\nHyun Sangmin's entire attention was devoted to the convenience store. Only now could he fully understand the point Seol had been making, the one that was teasingly within his reach but eluded him until now.\nThere were three things that a human couldn't do without if one wanted to continue living. One, three minutes without air. Two, three days without water. And three, three weeks without sustenance.\nIn other words, Seol came here with the purpose of solving the most basic need for one's survival.\n'Well, I guess he's not a Gold Mark for nothing, huh.'\nHyun Sangmin's gaping mouth didn't want to close. He couldn't hide his shock at all since he was only thinking of quickly getting to his destination ever since the details of the mission had been announced.\n'I gotta stay with this guy. Doesn't matter what happens, I gotta, definitely. Kang Seok can't even lick this guy's boots, for crying out loud!'\nIt wasn't as if Hyun Sangmin carried any ill feelings towards Kang Seok and his crew. But there was an undeniable difference between Seol and those guys who simply ran to the main building. Should he say that the thought process was on another level altogether? It was to the point where Hyun Sangmin had to question whether Seol was the same human being as the rest of them.\n“I thought it would be a tuck shop, but it turns out it's a convenience store. The students of this school must have had it real good.”\n“Hold up!”\nSeol was about to enter the convenience store when his shoulders were grabbed by the visibly excited Hyun Sangmin, who then proceeded to lightly pound on his chest like a proud gorilla.\n“Good. Great! Freaking amazing! I get it now. Let me handle this from now on.”\n“?”\n“You were planning to go upstairs after sweeping this place clean, right?”\n“Something like that. So?”\n“What if there's something inside? It's times like this you're supposed to use me.”\nDeclaring so, Hyun Sangmin sneaked inside the convenience store. However, most of the corridor's right side wall was made up of glass, so one could literally look inside the stores from the outside.\nShortly thereafter, Hyun Sangmin raised his hand and sent an okay signal, as if he had finally ascertained that everything was perfectly in order. Seol had already checked the place out with his ability, so he could only chuckle softly as he entered.\nThe first place they checked out was, of course, the convenience store. The place was smaller than they expected, but still, each of the shelves was stocked to the brim with various food items.\n“Keh. This is so good. So damn good!”\nHyun Sangmin popped open the lid of a can of Cola and gulped it down.\n“Hey, let's hurry up. It'll get very awkward for us if we take too long and the monster shows up.”\n“Roger that!”\nHyun Sangmin seemed to be genuinely enjoying himself while robbing the store. Seol too began stuffing his bag with things like canned foods, sealed instant kimbap[2], and others that were small but packed with energy.\nAnd while they were busy sweeping everything away…\n“Mm? What's going on?”\n“What? What happened?”\nSeol realized that something was off when he was about to stuff the bag with a bottle of water.\nAlthough he was carefully arranging things as he shoved them inside the bag, there seemed to be a lot of space left over still. It was a similar story with the weight too. Since he had stuffed the bag with lots of things, it should weigh a ton by now, yet all he could sense was only a slight increase in the overall weight.\n“….I guess even our bags got discriminated, huh.”\nHyun Sangmin was envious, seeing that his bag was already bursting at the seams.\nIn the end, Seol even had to sweep the daily necessities away into the bag just to make it seem near full. After they ransacked the convenience store clean, they began going through the library and the stationery store separately.\nUnfortunately, the results weren't as encouraging. A map of the basement was discovered in the library, but they already had one, so it was of no use. It was the same story for the stationery shop; well, they certainly didn't need a notebook or a pen right now. They did pick up a few cutting knives just in case, and soon, they left the underground corridor for good.\nHyun Sangmin was whistling a tune as they climbed up the staircase, but when Seol gave him the signal, he quietened down right away.\nWhen they got to the first floor, they ran into a huge ivory-colored metal door. The acrid odor of blood assaulted their noses when the door was creaked open ever so slightly.\n[The Diary of an Unknown Student has been updated.]\n“I think that's the place.”\n“What place?”\n“You know, the locked entrance I told you about. The door was locked, but I could look inside just fine, you see. I'm pretty sure of it now, seeing that staircase right over there. However….”\nHyun Sangmin deeply frowned.\n“God damn it. A lot of people must've died here. They did gain the entry somehow, though, by the look of things.”\nIt was as he said; through the open gap, Seol could see bits of broken glass and splashes of blood lining the floor. The steps of the staircase going up were painted in such a thick amount of blood that it was hard to tell what their original color might have been.\n[#Main Building, first floor, main entrance (an excerpt from the Diary of an Unknown Student, page 7)]\nThe friend who stepped out first screamed. Another friend following out right after tried to stop in a hurry but slipped like someone being swept away.\nOnly after we lost two more of our friends did we realize the trick to the staircase….\n“You know, those stairs gives me the creeps. How about we forget about those, and carry on with our staircase, instead?”\nSeol agreed with Hyun Sangmin's suggestion. Besides, they already had a staircase behind them that led up anyways, so no real need to utilize that one over there.\nMost importantly, though— those steps were shining in a deep orange glow within Seol's vision— do not approach, in other words.\nSeol carefully closed the door and turned around. They quietly but quickly mounted the stairs and soon, their destination came into view.\nHowever, what greeted them by the entrance to the second floor wasn't another ivory-colored metal door. No, for some reason, several thick metal spikes stood there, blocking their progress.\n'It shouldn't be like this.'\nSeol checked the map one more time, but they were on the right path. This was the most direct route when considering the convenience store's location.\n“Do we need to press something?”\nHyun Sangmin looked around but couldn't find anything resembling a button nearby.\nSeol stared at the metal spikes for a bit, before his brows furrowed slightly.\n'They don't have any colors to them?'\nIf they were not in green color, then it meant they were not 'normal'.\nSeol tilted his head a bit, before reaching out with his hand.\nAnd at the exact moment his hand touched the metal spike….\n[1] This talks about a chapter from an ancient Chinese text called 'Zhuangzi'.

As soon as those metal spikes were gone, the space in the front became a wide-open passageway they could enter.\n“W-What the hell just happened? What did you do?”\nHyun Sangmin was full of questions as he tried to follow after Seol and walk past the area of the spike barrier.\nSlam!\n“Huh!?”\nAs soon as Seol walked past, the spikes shot right back up and slammed into the ceiling once more. Having become separated, Hyun Sangmin held onto the spike barrier and shouted out in alarm.\nSeol also fell into a state of confusion. But he spotted a red button mounted on the interior wall near the barrier. He quickly pressed it, and the metal barrier squeaked noisily before retracting again, just as he suspected it might.\n“D-Damn… Feels like I lost ten years of my life just now.”\nHyun Sangmin hurriedly entered past the barrier and rubbed his chest to calm his pounding heart.\n[Mister Hyun Sangmin has arrived at the second-floor waiting area.]\nHearing that, Seol flinched slightly. He was caught off guard as he had forgotten about the automatic arrival announcements.\nWhen he took a glance at Hyun Sangmin, he was only spitting out sighs of relief. It seemed that he had not noticed the announcement yet. Perhaps he missed it from all the shouting, as well as the sound of the metal barrier opening and closing.\n“Oh! So you've finally arrived…. Hm?”\nKang Seok was waving his hand towards Seol, but when he spotted Hyun Sangmin, the ends of his sentence trailed off.\n“…What the. You two decided to work together?”\nHyun Sangmin raised his head after hearing Kang Seok's rather unhappy tone of voice.\n“What about you then?”\n“Well, as you can see. We arrived here a long time ago.”\nKang Seok winked in a playful manner.\nSeol looked around and found Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo as well.\nThe so-called waiting area reminded him of a regular high school corridor. With the exception of steel bars barricading the windows, everything looked the same. At the end of the passage to the left, there was another door, and to the right, a solid wall.\n“This place is like a prison…. That monster can't possibly enter here, right?”\n“It can't. Dunno why, but that thing can't seem to get past the metal barrier. No telling what will happen if there was no barrier, though.”\nKang Seok replied nonchalantly. Meanwhile, Hyun Sangmin was nodding his head along, before quietly asking back.\n“Back then…. did you manage to open the door?”\n“Not open, but more like breaking it down. Thanks to a certain someone high tailing it outta there, after throwing down rocks and flower pots all over the place.”\n“You’re blaming me?”\nHyun Sangmin's voice was icy cold. Kang Seok's eyebrows rose up before he smirked softly.\n“No way! I told you this before, didn't I? I don't really care what you do unless it involves the three of us. As long as you don't hinder us in any way, it's fine.”\n“….”\n“Hmm. Maybe I sounded a bit rude just now. Sorry about that. I'm always like this…. Well, there's no reason for us Invited to be at odds with each other, right?”\n“…That’s true.”\n“Great! As an apology, I'll let you guys in on interesting info.”\nEven Seol had to shift his attention to Kang Seok's direction after hearing the word, ‘info’.\nKang Seok's lips twitched when he realized that none other than this fancied 'Gold Mark' was paying attention to him. His posture suddenly became a bit stiffer and more arrogant compared to before.\n“Now look closely. This here is the passage we came through.”\nKang Seok pointed to his back, and then pressed a button on the wall. The metal spikes retracted to the floor before shooting back up again. Hyun Sangmin muttered under his breath.\n“So, it's not on the outside, but inside….”\n“That's right! That's where it gets interesting.”\nKang Seok clapped his hands.\n“To put it simply, this entrance became mine as soon as I entered first. Only I can open or close the barrier.”\n“What?”\n“I only figured it out after entering here. The first one to enter through the barrier is given the right to control it. One person per barrier, though.”\n“How does that even make sense?”\n“If you don’t believe me, why don’t you try it out?”\nKang Seok stepped aside, allowing Hyun Sangmin to quickly press the button on the wall. However, there was no reaction from the barrier. He pressed it a second time, then a third, and then many more times afterwards, but the metal spikes didn't budge an inch.\nStill half in doubt, Seol's eyes drifted towards the map on the phone, and he belatedly realized something. Out of the six blue icons blinking around the second-floor waiting area, four had now turned red. However, only one was red when he was in the club room.\n“Was there a need to make three entrances yours?”\n“Oh? How did you figure that out already?”\nSeol's question caused Kang Seok to become visibly surprised.\n“What's the matter? Don't you think it'll get more interesting later on? Oh, right. How about you make that other one yours?”\nKang Seok stared at Hyun Sangmin and pointed towards another barrier on the opposite side.\n“Well, passages on this side all belong to us now, so you should take one from that side over there. All you have to do is to grab the spike. Simple, right?”\nIt seemed that Hyun Sangmin was quietly debating on it. He sneaked a glance at Seol, then slowly shook his head.\n“I'm… gonna pass. I'm fine with simply being here and all.”\nHe and Seol then found a nice little spot for themselves and settled down.\n“Oh well. Do whatever you want.”\nKang Seok and his two lackeys sat down too, but soon, they had to get back up again as Hyun Sangmin pulled out a new pack of cigarettes. The trio reached out and pleaded for a smoke, so Hyun Sangmin handed one to each while saying it was compensation for providing the info.\nThen, just as Seol was digging through his own pockets to find a smoke too, Hyun Sangmin presented a whole bundle to him.\n“How about smoking these?”\n“Uhm….”\n“I saw earlier that you were running out, so I packed in a few at the convenience store.”\nHyun Sangmin whispered quietly and gave Seol a thumbs-up.\nSoon enough, the corridor was filled with the blue smoke rising from the five men.\nNow that most of the tension had ebbed away, Seol's sight slowly blurred and he felt his eyelids had become much heavier than before. It wasn't like he had to endure an all-nighter, yet he felt quite drowsy. This was probably due to the fatigue accumulated from overusing his ability.\n'Should I sleep for a bit?'\nThey had over three hours left until the time limit.\nIt seemed that sleep was the best means to cool down his overworked eyes and brain. He knew now wasn't the best time to close his eyes and drift away into the slumberland, but…. He had regained his power somehow. It'd be deathly stupid if he lost it again through overuse.\nSeol entrusted himself to the encroaching embrace of sleep.\nAnd that was why he couldn't hear it.\n*\n“….I can't tell whether he's got balls of steel or doesn't really care about the Tutorial.”\nSeeing Seol's head droop ever so lower in sleep, a wry smile broke out on Kang Seok's face. He flicked the cigarette butt away and groaned out.\n“Just when is this supposed to end? It'd be so much better if it ended soon.”\n“We still have over three hours left…. Fuck this. Why are we waiting for four hours in a mission like this?”\nYi Hyungsik grumbled as he rechecked the mission details on his phone. Kang Seok silently agreed with that opinion and massaged his head with his interlocked hands.\n“I'm so~ bored. I really hope someone comes through the path on this side.”\n“What if no one else shows up?”\n“Eii, no way. The rest of the Invited haven’t shown up yet.”\n“What, you mean that Yi Seol-Ah? She's already dead, isn't she?”\n“Not that dumb bitch…. Ha, people who act like heroes always end up getting killed first.”\nKang Seok darkly muttered out those words, which made Jeong Minwoo lick his lips in regret.\n“What a waste, though.”\n“Yep, that I agree. But, then again, don't you worry. We still have one more left.”\n“Who?”\n“You know, the other one. What was her name? Yun Seora?”\n“Ah, that arrogant girl?”\nWhen Yi Hyungsik chimed in, the three of them giggled out in sync. Their laughter sounded leery and ominous.\n“Whatever. Maybe I should catch up on some sleep myself.”\nKang Seok's yawn was large enough to nearly rip open his jaws. Just as he was about to lie down, something happened.\nOut of the blue, noises containing both loud shouts and hurried footsteps could be heard from the distance. Kang Seok blinked his eyes a couple of times before shooting right back up. Excluding the sleeping Seol, everyone present scanned the barriers.\n“Which one? Which one is it?”\nJeong Minwoo pointed towards the middle barrier on the opposite side. Since Seol had “taken” over the left barrier there, that particular one had no owner as of yet. Kang Seok seemed to be incredibly disappointed by this development as he looked at Hyun Sangmin.\n“It's still not too late, though.”\n“….I told you, I'm fine.”\nKang Seok spat out a sigh and stood there with his hands across his chest. His attitude was that of a man who had just found something interesting to spectate on.\nThe noise got closer very soon.\nThere were three people running up as if they were being chased by something— a middle-aged man, a woman, and a young girl. The middle-aged man was wearing a worn-out business suit and a pair of glasses, and was leading the woman holding the young girl's hand. His necktie danced uncontrollably as he ran up in a huff. It was none other than the man who asked for Kang Seok's help earlier on.\n“Just a little bit further! Just a bit…. Huh!?”\nHe rounded the corner in a hurry, but as soon as he saw the metal spikes on top of the stairs, his steps came to an abrupt halt. He must not have considered the possibility of the path being blocked. Despair began to dye his expression pale.\nSoon, though, he discovered Kang Seok past the spike barrier. The woman and the girl following him ran into the middle-aged man's back and awkwardly bounced back. And finally, sharp and familiar-looking hooks pounced on them. All these things happened at roughly the same time.\n“Help us!!”\nThe bespectacled man ran up to the barrier without hesitation and shouted out.\n“Let us in!!”\n[A new user has been registered.]\nWith a loud clang, the metal barrier slid open. The wide-open entrance caused the expression of stupor to appear on the man's face. And when he turned around to look behind him while still carrying that expression…..\n“Help!”\n….He couldn't help but flinch. Both his wife and daughter were already in the grips of the chasing monster.\n“Help us!!! Help!! Dear!!”\n“Dad!! Save us!! Daaaad!!”\nThey pleaded, yet the man's steps were halting and retreating. When he met the gaze of the monster and its large, bloodshot eye…\n“D-Dear… Hee, Heejin….”\nHe couldn't move. He was completely frozen up.\nSplat, splat!!\nStep by step, the sticky footsteps got nearer. The middle-aged man's expression distorted into an unsightly mess of tears, snot, and uncertainty. He cast his glance over to Kang Seok, asking for help again. However, the young man bluntly spat out.\n“Quickly make up your mind, will you?”\n“…Huh?”\n“Are you going to come in or not? Make up your damn mind. You planning on killing us too?”\nWas it because of Kang Seok's shouting or was it because of the threatening atmosphere emanating from him? Whichever case it may be, the middle-aged man finally made his decision and moved.\nSlam!\n“D-Dad!?”\n“Dear!! No! Don't leave us!!”\nThe middle-aged man chose to enter the waiting area.\n“Daaaaad!!”\n“Don't abandon us!!! Dear!!”\nA pair of jet-black hands grabbed the legs of the screaming mother and daughter. The man squeezed his eyes shut after seeing his family being lifted up into the air, hanging upside down.\nRip!\nThe sickening noise akin to a sheet of silk being ripped up in one go pierced his ears. The terrified, pained screams rang out loudly from the stairwell. The man collapsed on the floor and hurriedly covered his ears. He violently shook around on the dusty and unclean floor.\nHe never lifted his head up again.\nNot until all the screams finally died down.\n*\nIt was only obvious that Seol would wake up from his light sleep due to all the unfolding chaos. By the time he fully regained his consciousness, the screams couldn't be heard anymore.\nHe hastily got up and took a look past the metal barrier, only to see the corpses of the mother and the daughter— both ripped in half.\nWhat shocked Seol the most, though, was their expressions. Their expressions that hadn't eased even after they died. Their expressions, twisted and corrupted by the combination of pain and terror, despair and fury. It was plain to see their ardent desire to live, right up until their last breath.\n“I, I, I…. I don't, I don't know…. I, I didn't do that, I'm not responsible….”\nThe middle-aged man remained on the floor, huddled and not moving, except that his entire body trembled and shook all the time.\n“There…. there was no helping it….. There was…. nothing I could do….”\nNo one said anything, yet he continuously spat out incoherent babble while sobbing pathetically on the floor.\n“Pffft.”\nOut of the blue, a short burst of laughter leaked out from someone's lips. The middle-aged man's trembling came to a sudden halt, hearing that. Meanwhile, Kang Seok hurriedly covered up his mouth.\n“Puhahahahaha!!!”\nEven though he looked like he was trying to keep it in, in the end, he lowered his head and his shoulders shook from the unrestrained laughter. The middle-aged man's hands tightly clenched into fists, nails digging in under the skin.\nA wise old saying said that if you weren’t planning to give something to a beggar, you shouldn't at least kick his begging bowl. Recalling that old saying, a deep frown formed on Seol's face.\n'He’s actually laughing in a situation like this?'\nIt was then. They could all hear another metallic clang. Yun Seora walked in from the last remaining door that had no assigned “owner”.\nAs if she too had searched through the school premises, she was holding a handful of A4-sized papers. Just like back when she was in the assembly hall, she swept her gaze around the waiting area once, found a quiet spot for herself and settled down, before concentrating on a paper in her hand.\nAnd with this, the confirmed number of survivors was seven. It was not even half of the starting 36.\nWithin the quiet silence, time continued to flow. Every now and then, they could hear some kind of chaos unfolding downstairs, but those died down eventually.\nSeol came to a conclusion. There shouldn't be any more survivors left. However, his thought was proven wrong about 30 minutes before the time limit.\n“We are almost there, everyone. We'll arrive there soon, so go up as quietly as possible.”\nContrary to his expectations, more survivors showed up. And it wasn't just one or two, but a group of five. Seol even recognized two people.\nOne was Shin Sang-Ah, the woman who raised her voice at Kang Seok back in the assembly hall, and the other one was Yi Sungjin, the younger brother of Yi Seol-Ah. He didn’t know what they went through, but they had successfully arrived at the destination.\nUnfortunately, the path they had taken was occupied by Kang Seok and his cronies.\n“Oh, wow, look who it is!”\nKang Seok blinked his eyes and theatrically exclaimed out in surprise.\n“So, you managed to make it alive! The cry-baby has done it!”\n“H–huh?”\nShin Sang-Ah had been climbing the steps cautiously, but finding the barrier, she fell into a state of confusion. Seeing the people beyond the metal spikes, she blankly muttered out a question.\n“What… what is going on? Why is the path blocked?”\n“Oh, that?”\nKang Seok smirked like a snake. It was as if the moment he'd been waiting for all his life had finally arrived. Seeing that oily smile, Shin Sang-Ah couldn't help but frown deeply.\n“What?”\n“What do you mean, what? I'm the owner of this barrier.”\n“The owner… of this barrier?”\nKang Seok burst out in laughter and began to gleefully explain things. It was as if he had transformed into a well-paid private tutor, and explained everything one by one, bit by bit, and in full gory detail.\nOf course, his audience wouldn't be able to concentrate on this useless yammering. Shin Sang-Ah became even more anxious as she kept on looking back behind her. The tone of her voice became ever so urgent as well.\n“I get it now, so you can open this barrier, right?”\n“Oho, you’re smarter than you look! Or maybe my explanation was just that good.”\n“I get it, so open up already!”\n“Really now, how did you manage to get here? I mean, you’re just a Contracted. I’m surprised you managed to evade the monster.”\nKang Seok showed no indication that he heard her plea and seemed to be genuinely enjoying this situation.\n“I, I don't know. We nearly got discovered, but this boy used something he got from the Random Box. We all escaped somehow during the confusion, okay?”\nShin Sang-Ah pointed at Yi Sungjin. The boy's complexion was still dark and aimless. It seemed that the death of his older sister had hit him real hard.\n“Oh, well, I guess he’s an Invited too. So at least it wasn't all luck.”\n“Okay, now. Open the barrier so that we can enter.”\n“Hmm….”\nKang Seok slowly opened his mouth.\n“I don’t wanna.”\nA truly disgusting smile crept up on his face."

    "content": "“Are you crazy?! Open the barrier right now!!”\n“Why should I? This here is my doorway. I decide what to do with it.”\n“Why are you acting like this? Do you have any idea just what we had to go through to get here?”\n“Aigoo~. So, you had to go through so much, huh? But, what should I do? According to a certain someone, I'm an egocentric, petty son of a bitch.”\nShin Sang-Ah gritted her teeth while listening to Kang Seok's sarcastic remarks. She could more or less tell why this asshole was acting this way. Clearly, he was still holding a grudge against her for that verbal spat back in the assembly hall.\nShe held back her anger and spoke to him in a level voice.\n“I apologize. I apologize for calling you names when we were in the assembly hall, so please open this barrier. It's not just me here, too. These people haven't done anything to you. You shouldn't treat people's lives as a joke.”\n“Ooh… now that’s not what I expected to hear from you. Are you being honest?”\n“…Of course.”\n“Well, I guess I don't have much choice here then. Fine. Prove it to me.”\n“Prove it?”\n“The other four with you, I'll let them in. You stand back.”\nShin Sang-Ah's jaw dropped to the floor. Her expression screamed, ‘what kind of an asshole would act like this?’ Unfortunately for her, Kang Seok's expression showed how relaxed he was.\n“You….. You…..”\n“What are you going to do? That monster might show up soon, you know~.”\nShin Sang-Ah didn't expect Kang Seok to behave like this, and her face reddened up considerably as a result. However, with the exception of Yi Sungjin, the other three were looking at her with pleading eyes. Their stares were laden with a certain pressure. She gritted her teeth and took three, four steps back.\n“Oh, wow, a martyr, aren’t you?”\nKang Seok exclaimed out loud as he pressed the release button. As soon as the barrier was lowered, the three rushed inside. Yi Sungjin stared at Shin Sang-Ah for a bit before belatedly trudging past the barrier as well. Only afterwards did the trio begin calling out to her, crying out her name out in a helpless manner. The barrier closed shut regardless.\nHowever, Yi Sungjin suddenly reached out towards the button to press it. He'd been watching Kang Seok's hand quite intently just now.\nOf course, nothing happened. Seeing this, Kang Seok broke out in laughter.\n“Don’t waste your time. Didn't I tell you? Only I can open the barrier.”\nYi Sungjin suddenly pounced on Kang Seok. However, it couldn't even be called a fight from the get-go. The teen boy got easily subdued by Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo, and he could only glare at Kang Seok in rage.\n“Bastard, do you have a death wish? What, did that bitch tell you she'll become your new sister or something?”\n“Open… the barrier!”\n“That's up to me, and I kept my end of the deal.”\n“….”\n“Good job. You can go look for another path or something now. Good luck.”\nShin Sang-Ah couldn't bring herself to leave just like that. She scanned the inside of the waiting room, hoping for something or someone to save her, but that turned out to be a waste of time. The people inside were either spectating or looking unconcerned.\nIn the end, she turned around helplessly.\n“Should I let you in?”\nHearing this, Shin Sang-Ah's steps came to a halt. She abruptly spun her head and shot Kang Seok a murderous look.\n“Do you actually enjoy toying with people?”\n“Yup. When would I ever get to have fun like this if it's not today?”\nKang Seok nonchalantly replied and gestured her to come closer.\n“Stop being difficult and come over here. You saw me letting people in just now, right? I'm the kind of guy who keeps his promises.”\nHearing his words of keeping promises, Shin Sang-Ah was gripped by an intense bout of doubt and uncertainty. But thinking about the hardships she suffered to get here, she couldn’t imagine looking for another path.\nPlus, even if there was another path, she had to search for it alone. She figured it'd be better to get bitten by a rabid dog once.\nShe made up her mind and turned around to face him.\n“….What do you want me to do?”\n“I'm not asking for much. Just apologize for the things you said back in the assembly hall.”\n“But I already did….”\n“No, no, it was clear to anyone watching that you weren’t sincere. Besides, I'm not the type to believe in apologies coming out of a person's mouth.”\n“Then what do you want me to do?”\nShin Sang-Ah raised her voice when Kang Seok remained sarcastic to the end. He rubbed his chin as his eyes scanned her lecherously. Shin Sang-Ah did not possess the same sort of ‘fresh’ appeal as Yi Seol-Ah, but her skin was pale and smooth, and her rack was commendably voluptuous.\nA sinister smirk formed on Kang Seok's lips.“First, take them off.”\n“….What?”\nShin Sang-Ah couldn't help but question her own hearing.\n“Take your clothes off. Ah, I'm a nice guy, so I'll let you keep your panties. Cool?”\nHearing Kang Seok's 'benevolent' tone of voice, Shin Sang-Ah even forgot to close her wide-open mouth.\n“I think I’ll feel a little better if you perform a little show with a nude dance…. How about you twerk for me?”\n“You… you insane… son of a bitch!”\n“Don't wanna do it? Fine. Fuck off, then.”\nKang Seok shrugged his shoulders.\nShin Sang-Ah bit her lower lip until one could clearly see the teeth mark on her flesh. She inwardly mumbled, ‘This crazy son of a bitch.’\nThen, her body shook from the belated sense of humiliation. Tears welled up in her eyes, ready to fall at any moment.\nUnfortunately for her, that moment when her group ran into the monster still played heavily on her mind. What if, she went downstairs now and ended up encountering the monster again….?\n“What are you waiting for? As I said, you can fuck off if you don't wanna do it.”\n“…I'll do it.”\n“Then hurry the hell up. I'll give you ten seconds to take your pants off. Starting now.”\nWhen Kang Seok really started counting down, Shin Sang-Ah had no choice but to hurriedly undo her buttons. She hesitated when it came to pulling her pants down, but after hearing the rapid countdown, she still forced her jeans down all the while shaking like a leaf in the wind.\nKang Seok made a catcalling whistle as Shin Sang-Ah’s bare thighs were revealed to the cold air.\n“Hiyaa~, you’ve got a great figure. Your underwear is pretty cute too.”\nShin Sang-Ah squeezed her eyes shut, hoping this would lessen the humiliation she felt even by a tiny amount.\n“What are you doing? Keep stripping, girl. I'm gonna count down again… Huh? Huuuuh!? It's the monster!! The monster!!”\nKang Seok suddenly cried out in alarm and pointed at the staircase behind her while hurriedly taking a step back. Shin Sang-Ah's eyes shot open in shock. She screamed in terror and tumbled forward in an ungainly fashion.\n“Mommy!”\nOut of reflex, she looked behind her, only to find nothing there. Rather than the monster, the staircase was as empty as it could possibly get. Sure enough, she could hear several loud and detestable chortles coming from beyond the barrier.\n“Did you hear that? You heard that, right? She said Mommy! Mommy!! Hahahaha!!”\n“Haha, that was fucking adorable. Kyak! Mommy!”\nWhen Yi Hyungsik imitated Shin Sang-Ah’s cries, Kang Seok and Jeong Minwoo burst into laughter. Lost for words, all Shin Sang-Ah could do was to let tears accumulate around the edges of her eyes.\n“Sorry, sorry. I was just teasing you a bit. You looked really cute just now.”\nToo much.\n“Well~ now. It's time to remove your top, right?”\nThis is too much.\nIn the end, she couldn't hold it in any longer and broke down in tears.\n“You're crying? Hey, now. You shouldn't cry, you know~. You gotta take your clothes off and dance for me before….”\nKang Seok clapped his hands boisterously and laughed before suddenly shutting his mouth. Unknowingly, a dark shadow was looming over him.\n*\nSeol wasn't angry from the beginning. He initially planned to ignore the matter.\nHe was neither a saint nor a man of justice. Like most people, he was disinclined to interfere in other people's business. Even if he saw something he considered unjust, he would only frown and think, ‘Isn’t that going too far?’\nUnless it was someone he knew, Seol would never personally get up and do something for a total stranger.\nHowever….\nWhen his eyes landed on Yi Sungjin, or more specifically when he heard him whisper ‘help us’ as he was pinned down to the ground, he had a change of heart.\nPerhaps it was a coincidence, but the scene happened to remind him of the time Yi Seol-Ah asked for help in the assembly hall.\nSeol's emotions trembled. The small tremor soon spread out like some sort of a mutated butterfly effect and it violently quaked, eventually transforming into a rage.\nThat was why he stood up.\n…Just like the day he had that dream.…Just like the experience he had in the assembly hall.\n[Innate Ability, Future Vision, has been activated.]\n…Just like the way his emotions were leading him to.\n“What? You also want to join in on the fun….?”\n“That’s enough. Open the barrier please.”\nKang Seok dazedly stared up at Seol. He hadn't realized it until now, but Seol was taller than him.\n“I'll open it. When I feel like it.”\n“Open. The. Barrier.”\nKang Seok shut his mouth. Judging from his expression, it seemed like he just couldn’t understand.\n“Did you inhale something weird? Who the hell are you to order me around?”\n“Open it.”\nKang Seok's complexion hardened.\nFor some strange reason, he found it difficult to meet Seol's gaze. Even his balls seemed to shrink a bit. He didn't want to admit it out loud, but Kang Seok was scared. It was as if he was staring at a choice of whether he should cross a line he should never even consider crossing in the first place.\nHis instincts forced him to press the button. However, just before he actually did that, Kang Seok's defiant streak reared its head. He couldn’t help but think, ‘Why should I listen to this son of a bitch? Because he has a Gold Mark? What a fucking joke.’\nKang Seok arrogantly leaned his head back.\n“I don't want to.”\nThe corners of his lips slowly wiggled and twitched.\n“Listen here, I’m trying to stay friendly with all the Invited. Don’t be an asshat and go away.”\nSeol slowly raised his arm up, which prompted Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo to move as well. However, Kang Seok confidently stopped them by raising his own hand.\n“What? You’re gonna hit me? Fine, go ahead. If Almighty Gold Mark-nim wants to hit me, this lowly Silver Mark should just obediently get hit, no?”\n“….”\n“But remember this. The more you try to show off, the lesser I'll be inclined to open the…. Kuk!”\nThwack!\nSeol's fist slammed into Kang Seok's nose. Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo were taken by surprise but even they had to cry out in pain while grasping their noses. The speed at which Seol's fist flew was so scarily fast, they couldn't even see it.\n“Y-you son of a….. Kuaaaak!!”\nKang Seok reflexively threw a fist of his own, but Seol simply snatched it off the air and twisted it hard. The force was so severe that Kang Seok's knees gave out in one go. Seol then proceeded to drag his arm and forcibly pressed the button.\nThe barrier slid open.\n“Come in.”\nShin Sang-Ah carried a dazed expression as she stumbled into the waiting area, not even thinking of putting her pants back on. Only then did Seol release Kang Seok's arm.\n[Miss Shin Sang-Ah has arrived on the second-floor waiting area.]\n[The first Tutorial mission, 'Escape from the Assembly Hall', has concluded. Number of remaining survivors: 12.]\n[A new message from the Guide has arrived.]\n[The second mission of the Tutorial, 'Breaking Through Traps' has begun.]\nThey all heard the new announcements, and at the same time, the sturdy locked gate at the end of the corridor automatically undid itself. It seemed that, regardless of the remaining time, the next mission would be triggered right away once all the survivors arrived at the waiting area.\n“Kuuuuk!”\nKang Seok rolled on the floor in a fit of pain. Then, he used the wall to support himself and got up. Still holding his twisted arm, he glared at Seol with murderous intent.\n“You…!”\nKang Seok was about to shout out something, but then simply spun on his heels to leave.\n“We'll see what happens later, you fucking son of a bitch!”\nHe picked up his own bag and hastily escaped through the now-open passage. Seeing him retreat, both Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo slinked away from sight.\nNext, Yun Seora, who had been watching Seol silently, turned to leave.\n“T…. Thank you. Thank you so much….”\nThick teardrops fell from Shin Sang-Ah's eyes as she began to wail. Next to her, Yi Sungjin's head also dropped low.\nHowever, the recipient of their gratitude, Seol, wasn't feeling all that good. He knew his actions were not entirely from his own will.\nHis rage failing to cool down drove him further into an even greater frenzy. He felt like destroying, rampaging, and making an utter mess of everything.\n[Sender: The Guide.][1. Enter the classroom “3-1” on the fourth floor of the main building via annex's third floor before time runs out.][Remaining time: 01:57:56]\nTwo hours, and a time-limit type mission. After confirming the details of the next mission, Seol’s eyes burned with a dangerous light.\n“H-hey! Hold up!”\nSeol unhesitatingly walked forward, and Hyun Sangmin hurriedly chased after him with two bags.\n*\n[Area 1. The second mission is now commencing.]\nA robotic voice made an announcement as images flickered on a massive semi-transparent screen. Several men and women were sitting in front of this screen, watching the proceedings unfold.\n“It's only the second mission but…. Damn it, I'm gonna lose my mind at this rate.”\n“24 people died in the first stage? How does that even make sense? Why is every one of them such goddamn trash this time?”\nWhen a bald, giant of a man spat out in anger, a woman wearing a purple robe next to him grumbled unhappily as well. However, when another woman wearing a business suit sitting in front swept her icy gaze over them, the duo shut their mouths up rather quickly.\n“Really now. At this rate, the name 'Area 1' will become a huge joke. With March's overall assessment looking this bad, how are we supposed to endure until September?”\nThe bald giant couldn't resist and added a couple more sentences, but fearing that the business-suit woman would glare at him again, he hurriedly turned his attention to her.\n“Anyone know what's going on in the other areas? Anyone hear anything?”\n“Me.”\nA young man with curly hair raised his hand.\n“I overheard something while I was outside…. As far as clear speed is concerned, I hear Area 2 and Area 7 are neck and neck for the first place.”\n“2 and 7? I get the Europeans, but what’s up with those Chinese bastards?”\n“What’s the point in even asking? You already know what dirty tricks they are using over there. Their Invited all conspire together, and as soon as the Tutorial starts, they take all the Contracted hostage. I'm sure they are passing the missions while sacrificing the Contracted whenever necessary.”\nThe balding giant spat out a groan.\n“….Fine. What about 2?”\n“I heard they are the very example of perfection itself. A French girl named Odelette Delphine has taken over the show. With just pure skills, too. Well, her killing the phantom in front of everyone with the starting bonus she got during the first mission proved to be the decisive factor.”\n“Huh. What's her Mark?”\n“Silver. Also, as soon as the second mission began, she succeeded in opening up the path to the computer classroom. She's bulldozing everything in her way. I think she won't even need an hour to get to the end. Maybe 50 minutes tops?”\n“Wow, what is she, a monster? Europe really found a good seedling this time. What about the rest?”\n“Area 5 is doing decent… but, it's so-so. They’ve had a 30-minute head start for the second mission compared us, so there's that.”\nThe giant groaned out again.\n“God damn it. At this rate, we aren't gonna have a single one remaining at the end of the Tutorial.”\n“No way. Don’t forget, we have a Gold Mark. It looks like he even has the Diary of the Unknown Student. Surely he’ll be able to clear it with no problems.”\n“You think so?”\n“I mean, he chased that phantom away with nothing more than his glare, right?”\nThe curly-haired youth spoke with the aim of consoling the giant man, but the bald giant's face continued to show how disappointed he was as his eyes remained locked on the screen. Seol, as shown on the screen, was entering the annex via the pedestrian overpass connecting the two buildings.\n“Hey, doesn't that guy look a bit pissed off right now? What the hell? What's the matter with him all of a sudden?”\nThe curly-haired youth raised a shrill voice of surprise.\nAs the mission name suggested, the location reserved for the 'Breaking Through Traps' wasn't supposed to be tackled willy-nilly. Yet, Seol didn't even stop to take a look at his phone and simply strolled right in.\n“….Can we really trust a guy like that?”\nThe bald giant tapped the woman wearing the business suit.\n“Hey, say something, Kim Hannah.”\n“Shut your damn mouth for once, okay?”\nKim Hannah spat out in a voice full of undisguised irritation. The giant man immediately realized that if he tried to provoke her any further, he'd be on the painful receiving end of the hysteria of an unmarried spinster.\nThe giant licked his lips as if he found the whole thing unsatisfactory, then got up from his seat. He figured he would rather go out for a smoke break than sit here and get pissed off at what was happening on screen.\n*\nThe bald, big guy wasted around 15 minutes smoking outside. But, when he was about to enter the room again….\nClang! Clang!\nHe spat out a disappointed groan after hearing the noisy metallic clangs coming from inside. He thought that a brainless idiot was repeatedly stepping into traps, activating them inadvertently. While shaking his head, he opened the door to enter.\nClang!\nThen, he tilted his head, wondering if his eyes were playing tricks on him.\nIn truth, the second mission wasn't at all difficult for someone like this bald man. A highly trained Earthling would be able to clear it in around 30 minutes even if he was taking his time.\nHowever, the ones doing the mission right now weren't trained Earthlings, but a bunch of weak, powerless civilians. These people hadn't even experienced a proper war.\nThe goal of the mission was simple enough — to stop the activation of various traps by fulfilling a set of conditions beforehand. Or, leave it to lady luck to decide. That should have been the case. However….\n'He's evading, blocking, and deflecting!?'\nNot only did Seol not stop after performing those actions, he even deliberately triggered the traps that hadn't been activated yet. He was progressing forward while… destroying everything. It was like looking at an Earthling, not a powerless civilian.\nA look of disbelief was etched on the bald man's face as he hurriedly got closer to the screen. At the same time, three sharp metal spears were shooting out towards Seol from the ceiling and from both the right and left sides.\nClang! Claaaang!!\nIt was unknown where Seol had acquired a steel beam, but regardless, he spun it like a cartwheel; soon, the audience was treated to the cacophony of metallic clangs as well as a beam of cold silvery light flickering on the screen.\nThe result was all there to see. The moment the spears from the right and left were sent flying, the spear from the ceiling brushed past Seol and pierced the ground. The woman wearing the purple robe stood up reflexively, her fists clenched in anticipation.\n“Is he dead? No, did it miss?”\n“No, he dodged.”\nThe bald man closely watched the proceedings unfold, then confidently declared out loud.\n“I'm sure of it. He slapped away the spears coming from both of his sides, and he was about to do the same to the one coming from the ceiling, but….”\n“But?”\n“….Dunno. It's like, his body couldn't keep up with what he wanted to do. In any case, I definitely saw him tilt his head out of the way…. Oi, Kim Hannah! Just what's up with that guy?!”\nThe bald guy seemed to be shocked by his own words and belatedly shouted at Kim Hannah.\nKim Hannah remained quiet for a long while before suddenly opening her mouth.\n“For the second mission…. what’s the record for the fastest clear time?”\n“The record? You mean, Sung Shihyun-nim’s legendary 29 minutes and 38 seconds?”\nMm, mm. The bald giant nodded his head as if he was proud of something. Meanwhile, Kim Hannah's head dropped low, and eventually, she began rubbing her face as if she was feeling quite fatigued all of a sudden.\n“….This is crazy.”\n“What's crazy?”\n[Area 1's second mission has been cleared.]\nThe expressions of everyone present became dumbfounded by the sudden announcement.\n16 minutes, 24 seconds….\nThis was precisely the moment when history was rewritten."

    "content": "The label above the classroom door read ‘3-1’.\nSeol quietly opened the door. He looked to be in an overall pathetic condition while propping himself up with the metal spear serving as a makeshift cane.\nHis boiling-hot rage had cooled down by now, but the sense of emptiness filling him up after the end of his ability, Future Vision, was incredibly hard to endure. It was as if he was overcome with a bout of lethargy.\nThe new gathering area was a regular classroom that could be found in pretty much any school out there. Seol chose a chair and as soon as he sat down, he plopped down on the desk with a thud. His eyeballs hurt so much, he thought they might pop out at any moment now. He was also beset with intense fatigue..\nAnd as he stayed there, barely moving, the door opened again and the classroom gradually became somewhat crowded.\nThe total number of casualties during the second mission: 0.\nIt was an obvious result, really. Seol ended up destroying every single trap there, so it was not a surprise that everyone got to clear it without a fuss.\nThe survivors took an unsure glance at Seol who was still collapsed on the desk. Well, they had to bear witness to some unbelievable scenes that were simply beyond their ability to describe, so understandably, they couldn't stop staring at him. They already had some thoughts as to how special Seol could be, but still, their imagination had been easily exceeded.\n“Are you alright?”\nAfter flawlessly performing his duty as the trustworthy bag shuttle, Hyun Sangmin asked with a lot of worry in his voice. Seol simply waved his hand to imply, ‘don't worry about me.’\nShin Sang-Ah entered the classroom in hesitating, faltering steps, then found a chair in a quiet corner for herself and settled down while hiding her face. Yun Seora arrived a bit later after that. Finally, Kang Seok and his lackeys showed up, signaling that all 12 survivors had gathered in the classroom.\n“Well, well, well. I'm truly shocked.”\nWhen that familiar voice suddenly popped out of nowhere, Seol's eyes shot right open.\n“I couldn't have imagined you'd pass the second mission that quickly. Thanks to you all, my prestige has gone up a level in the meantime.”\nBehind the teacher's podium stood the 'Guide' from the assembly hall, still wearing that butler outfit of his. Everyone stared at Han as if he was some sort of a phantom.\n“I congratulate you on successfully arriving on the fourth floor. I have to ask, did you enjoy the proceedings of the first and second periods?”\nHis leisurely and bright tone of voice roused anger in the hearts of almost everyone present. But, they knew there was nothing they could do, so they simply had to swallow it back. Still, the breathing of the bespectacled, middle-aged man quickened noticeably.\n“I'm here to give you all great news. There is only one mission remaining in the Tutorial.”\n“There's another one?”\n“Yes. But, there is genuinely no reason to fret. The reason being….”\nThe ends of the Guide's eyes arched upwards.\n“…The remaining mission, it can actually become quite easy and enjoyable for everyone.”\n“Easy and enjoyable…?”\n“Yes. As long as you stick to the rules. All of you.”\nWhen the Guide emphasized the words ‘all of you’, a dangerous smile crept up his face.\n“Shall I start with the explanations, then? Ah, the mission this time is a little more complicated, and that is why I'm here. Besides, those announcements are so robotic and impersonal, no? Ahaha!”\nFor some reason, the Guide seemed to be in a really good mood.\n“Overall, this mission's goal is similar to the ones you had to go through until now. You are tasked with reaching the sixth floor via the fifth floor. However, there are a few more additional rules to consider this time.”\nThe Guide picked up a piece of chalk and drew a small circle on the blackboard.\n“This is a coin.”\n“….”\n“Have you heard of treasure hunt?”\n“….”\n“…I am beginning to truly appreciate the greatness of the teachers who teach those unresponsive students.”\nThe Guide's shoulders slumped forward rather theatrically, then, he played with his monocle.\n“Fine. I shall finish the explanation and disappear from your sights as soon as possible. On the fourth and the fifth floor, there are many such hidden coins waiting to be found. You all are required to find and amass as many coins as possible before nightfall.”\nHe then began writing on the blackboard again.\n1. The usages for the coins:—Entry fee—Lucky draws\n“There is a place on the sixth floor where the gate leading to the Paradise is scheduled to open.”\nThe mere mention of entry to Paradise caused a small commotion to rise up.\n“Unfortunately, there are no free lunches in the world. You will have to pay the appropriate entry fee. If you plan to enter the gate, you will need one hundred coins as the usage fee.”\n“One, one hundred? You need that many?”\n“Actually, that's not a lot.”\nHan shook his head.\n“The total number of hidden coins is 3000. With a little bit of leg work, finding 100 should be a cinch.”\nHan spoke up to here, before letting out a gasp of “Ah!”\n“Now that I think about it, there are coins hidden in this classroom too….”\nSuddenly, the sound of a chair being slid across the floor could be heard. A woman stood up and took a quick stride towards the podium, then began rummaging through it. It was none other than Yun Seora. Soon, she straightened her back and sure enough, four yellowish coins rested on her palm.\nHan showed some surprise after seeing a stack of papers clutched in Yun Seora's hand.\n“I see that you have searched through the staff room on the first floor. Those documents were useless until past the third floor, but from here onwards, they should prove to be quite helpful.”\nStill carrying an indifferent expression on her face, Yun Seora returned to her seat.\n'Did she find a map that shows where the coins are?'\nIf that were the case, then Yun Seora held an overwhelming advantage on this mission. Seol couldn't help but feel a bit envious.\nHan continued on in the meantime.\n“On the fifth-floor library, you will find an item draw machine.”\n‘Item draw?’\nThe expressions of the people present became confused after hearing an unexpected announcement.\n“Those of you who manage to amass lots of coins must use this machine! You will definitely be able to acquire many things that will aid you in your journey.”\n“L-Like what, exactly?”\n“You'll find out once you get there, but they will be things like food, consumable goods, etc, etc….”\nFor some reason, Han quietly stared at the person who asked the question, causing Shin Sang-Ah to lower her gaze in a hurry and cross her legs in a defensive manner.\n“….Well, if your luck is good, then you might even receive a protective item of some kind. Also, weapons and spell balls as well….”\n'Weapons? Spell balls?'\nSeol narrowed his eyes.\n“Or, when you pour in a lot~ of coins in one go, you might find unique and special items. Items such as….”\nHan deliberately stretched his sentence trying to create a sense of anticipation.\n“….A legendary elixir that can bring the dead back to life.”\nThe devastated and downtrodden middle-aged man's gaze shot towards the front of the classroom. Even the dazed Yi Sungjin visibly flinched.\n“Is, is that true?”\n“Noona can be revived? Really?”\nHan nodded his head at the two's hurried shouts.\n“Of course. However, you need to meet lots of requirements first. It's definitely not going to be easy. You shouldn't take the act of reviving a dead person so lightly…. Stop what you're doing this instant.”\nHan's icy voice reverberated throughout the classroom. The middle-aged man with the worn-out business suit had shot out from his seat and was heading towards the exit, but he had to stop and hesitate.\n“You won't find any coins even if you leave now. The treasure hunt will only commence precisely 30 minutes after I finish my explanations.”\nEven though Han's words were simple to understand, the middle-aged man showed no signs of sitting down. He simply staggered towards the door and stopped right in front of it.\nHan clicked his tongue in disapproval before spotting an oddity with the corner of his eye. It was Seol, who had raised his hand to ask a question.\n“Please speak.”\n“Why are things like weapons, defensive items, and spell balls available from the item draw machine?”\n“Hmm? Conversely, is there a reason they shouldn't be available?”\n“Why would we need items in a mission that's supposedly easy and enjoyable?”\n“….Fufufu. I like these kinds of questions.”\nThe hardened expression of the Guide softened considerably.\n“Such questions mean that the listener isn't just taking things at face value and is constantly evaluating the situation…. For now, here is the answer to your question.”\nHan winked once, pulled out his smartphone, and tapped on the screen.\n[A message from the Guide has arrived.]\n“I'm not lying to you. If all of you can cooperate together, this mission will become very easy to clear. And you will even get to enjoy it. I guarantee this.”\nHan dropped the chalk and raised a finger.\n“And also, if I were to provide you with one more helpful hint…. Keep an eye out for the Hour of the Deceased, please. The Deceased carry an unending hatred for all living things, after all.”\n'The Hour of the Deceased!?'\nSeol hurriedly pulled out his phone to check the message.\n[Sender: The Guide]\n[1. Rules of the treasure hunt]—Classroom 3-1 will be set as your safe zone from here onwards.—The period between midnight till tomorrow midday will be designated as the Hour of the Deceased.—The phantom, 'Gaekgwi', and the Deceased are unable to enter the safe zone.\n[2. Requirements for gaining access to the sixth floor]—Access will be granted with the 'sixth-floor key' that can be drawn on the item draw machine using 199 coins, or by paying 499 coins at the door.\n[3. Requirements to activate the gate]—The gate will appear in the middle of the sixth floor, 30 minutes after the access has been granted.—When the access to the sixth floor has been granted, the metal barrier on the second floor will be removed immediately.\nWhen Seol raised his head, Han was already long gone.\n[The treasure hunt will begin in 30 minutes.]\nSeol began gritting his teeth.\n'Of course. I knew it.'\n“Hey, this isn't what you said!”\nHyun Sangmin roared out in frustration.\n“What? When we gain access to the sixth floor, the metal barriers on the second floor will be removed? Isn't that the same thing as saying that that goddamn monster will show up here sooner or later!?”\nSeol was deeply worried about that as well. The 30-minute gap during the sixth-floor door opening and the gate ready to activate held all the potential to be absolutely fatal for everyone here. Besides, they had to worry about these so-called Deceased, as well.\n“I mean, we can open the door to the sixth floor, and then come back here to wait out the 30 minutes, no?”\n“What the fuck? What would you do if that damn Gaekgwi monster is waiting for you in front of this safe zone? What then?”\nWhen someone voiced his opinion, Hyun Sangmin promptly shut that person down. Then he spat out a long groan.\n“Wow…. Nothing is easy. Not a damn thing. What should we do now?”\n“Well, it doesn't have to be so bad.”\nSeol spoke up.\n“We go out and find as many coins as we can until midnight, then we wait until midday tomorrow. Then, we draw as many weapons and whatever we can from the item draw machine before opening the sixth floor….”\n…Seol was about to finish his sentence with ‘we might stand a chance then’, but he couldn't, and instead simply clicked his tongue. \nYun Seora and the middle-aged man were no longer in the classroom. It was the same story for Kang Seok and his crew as well. Only seven people remained in the classroom.\n“….Oh, well. Wanna eat something? We still have some time left to kill and all.”\nSeol wordlessly nodded his head. He was actually starving after going on a rampage earlier on, anyways. He felt like he needed to eat something in order to regain his strength.\nWhen Seol poured out various food items from his bag, the eyes of everyone present, besides Hyun Sangmin, grew extra-wide in shock.\n“Come. Let's eat together. Even you, Mister Yi Sungjin.”\n“I'm….”\n“You won't find any coins even if you leave now. It'll be more beneficial for you in the long run to fill up your belly before you begin.”\n“I…. Thank you….”\nHyun Sangmin didn't seem to be too happy about Seol being so considerate but didn't try to stop him. After all, the food provided wasn't his to begin with, and there was plenty to go around anyways. Also, some of the food, like the gimbap, would go bad in a few days’ time. So they might as well give them away.\nAnd so, even Yi Sungjin joined in, leaving behind only one person.\n“What about you, Miss Shin Sang-Ah?”\nShin Sang-Ah remained sitting in the chair. Seol was about to ask why she wasn't joining them, but then, saw her desperately trying to hide her exposed lower half. He realized that her pants were still missing.\n“I, I was too busy trying to enter…. I f-forgot….”\n“Wouldn't it be okay to go and fetch it now?”\n“….I'm scared….”\nSeol took off his jacket and handed it over to her. Shin Sang-Ah expressed her deep gratitude, and after wrapping the jacket around her lower waist, she was finally able to stand again.\nAfterwards, a silent and uneasy meal commenced.\n“….You seem to have a good appetite.”\nShin Sang-Ah spoke in a surprised voice while unwrapping the packet of a cold sandwich. She saw Seol swallow hotbars in one go, and then proceed to devour several onigiris as well.\n'I wonder, since when did I have this much appetite?'\nSeol was also slightly confused by this and tilted his head. Even though this was all instant food from a convenience store, it tasted really good.\nThe funny thing was that when he was still addicted to gambling, nothing tasted nice to his palette…. Well, the wise old people once said that hunger was king. Seol simply wolfed down the sandwich that Shin Sang-Ah personally took out from the packet without asking another question.\nIt was around here that a young man who seemed to be around the age of a university student asked Seol.\n“Uhm…. We should start collecting those coins soon, right?”\n“Yes. You need to collect a minimum of 100 before you can pass.”\nThe young man seemed to be waiting for Seol's reply, as he hurriedly continued on.\n“That Guide said it, didn't he? That we could revive a dead person.”\n“Mm? Yes, he did.”\n“Actually, I came here with a friend of mine, but he…. Uhm, so, like, the thing is….”\nThe ends of his sentence blurred as he kept stealing glances in Seol's direction.\n“M-Me too!! I came here with an oppa I know well, but he, he tried to defend me and….”\nA girl suddenly jumped into the middle of the conversation, but she too couldn't get to finish her sentence and could only grow tearful in expression. She even stared at Seol with pleading eyes.\nObviously, Seol stopped eating. He was feeling rather flabbergasted. He was already having a headache while wondering how he should go about clearing this mission, so what exactly were these people trying to say here? More importantly….\n'What do they want from me now?'\n“Hey, you! Let's just have a meal in peace. In peace, I say!”\nHyun Sangmin shouted out loudly in an unhappy voice.\n“What do you all think you're doing? Seriously now!”\nHyun Sangmin furrowed his brows rather grandly as if to display how displeased he was.\n“Can't you see how tired he is right now? Just let him enjoy his food in peace already! You aren't even supposed to provoke a dog during meals, let alone an actual human!”\n“No, I'm just saying….”\n“Just saying this and that. But, who cares!? You want to revive someone, then do it yourself, alright? Seriously, all you have to do is to find enough coins, anyway. What do you expect from him, then?”\nHis abrasive and rude words led the duo's necks to visibly redden from heat. They didn't say anything else as a retort, but the young man simply snorted out as if he was dumbfounded or something similar. The girl too was visibly displeased.\nMeanwhile, Hyun Sangmin powerfully squeezed a packet of instant bread and popped it open, hard. If it weren't for Seol signaling with his eyes to take it easy, he might have started physically fighting the two.\nThe awkward meal eventually came to an end. Seol left the classroom and stepped into the corridor. It was almost time to begin the treasure hunt, but it was also because Hyun Sangmin had called him out there to have a chat.\n“I'm telling you this right now, I can't stand people like those two and I won't go around with them.”\nHyun Sangmin's voice was rather heated at the moment.\n“What useless fucking idiots! You found them a path, and hell, you even fed them food. Yet they want even more? Don't they have any shame!?”\nHe glared in the direction of the classroom, unable to dissipate his simmering anger. But, he suddenly lowered his voice.\n“You should be careful too.”\n“?”\n“From where I'm sitting, it looks like those two think you're an easy mark or something. I apologize if you think I’m overstepping my boundaries. But things like this, you gotta cut off the head right from the beginning, if you know what I mean.”\nSeol slowly nodded his head and then shook it slightly. Even if Hyun Sangmin didn't step forward just now, Seol knew he wasn't going to say something nice to those two as well. It would be the same story whether Future Vision was activated or not.\n“A person's true nature is only revealed when he's pushed right to the edge, am I right? Now that their bellies are full, and they are feeling all nice and comfy, they are acting like a bunch of spoiled assholes. I don't like guys like Kang Seok, but that bastard's opinions aren't half wrong.”\n“….”\n“You continue being nice to them, and they'll eventually end up thinking that it's their birthright or something. Well, in any case…. Don't ever trust those two stinking bitches, okay?”\n[The treasure hunt will now commence.][Remaining time until midnight 05: 29: 59]\nPeople began leaving the classroom one by one, leading Hyun Sangmin to do a couple of fake coughs to clear his throat.\n“Well, I'm sure you'll do what's best for you…. Anyways, I'm going. See you back here around midnight, okay?”\nHe lightly tapped Seol on his shoulder, affixed the bag on his back and disappeared through the stairwell.\nAlmost instantly, the whole floor seemed to come alive with lots of activity. Seeing a person run past him in a hurry, Seol decided to concentrate on finding coins himself. He figured that by amassing as many coins as possible, a new path forward would open up for himself.\n[The Diary of an Unknown Student has been updated.]\nSeol stood there wondering where he should go first before he pulled out his phone when the message entered his ears.\n[Sender: Unknown]\n[#4th floor, the corridor in front of the classroom 3-1 (excerpt from the Diary of an Unknown Student)]\n—4th floor, classroom 3-1, inside the teacher's podium (x4)\n—4th floor, classroom 3-2, inside the 4th desk on the 2nd row (x1)\n—4th floor, classroom 3-3, inside the 1st locker (x2)\n—4th floor, classroom 3-4, on the window sills facing the corridor (x3)\n…\n…\n“…Oh.”"

    "content": "Seeing the well-organized list, Seol's head automatically moved up and down in a nod of approval. He had no idea whose child this unknown student was, but he really did a fantastic job organizing it. \n'Most likely a top of the class honor student….'\nNow that he had leeway to spare, Seol no longer hurried and simply walked on the corridor in a relaxed gait. He found three, four people busily running around inside classroom 3-2, before spotting Shin Sang-Ah jumping up and down in joy while crying out “Yaaaaay!” inside 3-3. She then froze up like a deer in a headlight as soon as she saw him staring at her through the corridor window.\nSeol procured three coins by the window sill of classroom 3-4, then entered 3-5 only to run into someone he didn't expect to find so soon.\nIt was Yun Seora. She was in the middle of searching every nook and cranny. She only took a cursory glance when she heard the classroom door slide open, before turning her attention back to the treasure hunt. She kept on opening and digging through every single desk in the classroom.\nSeeing that, Seol couldn't help but tilt his head in confusion.\n'Why is she searching every desk like that? Doesn't she already have a map?'\nSeol's thoughts were only half correct. They both possessed maps, but the level of information contained within each one was quite different.\nFor instance, the information shown on the diary of the unknown student was as concise and precise as it could get, telling him 'classroom 3-5, 2nd desk in the 3rd row, x1' or '6th desk in the 5th row, x4'. However, Yun Seora's map only displayed vague hints, such as 'classroom 3-4, inside a desk'.\nUnless it was something like a teacher's podium that would only ever be one in a classroom, she'd have to roll up her sleeves and do some hard labor, as the coins were hidden inside one of the many lockers or desks there.\nYun Seora finally found a single coin and became rather pleased with the result. She then dropped it inside her bag and turned around.\n“?”\nThen, she spotted Seol casually finding four coins that were hidden inside a desk near the door. She blinked her eyes several times in shock.\n'Alright, let's see. Next is….'\nNext, Seol headed to the classroom 3-6. By the time Yun Seora recovered from her shock and belatedly followed him, Seol had already swept the place clean.\n'Too easy. Way too easy.'\nSeol whistled and happily went about his task. He was deeply worried before, yet now that a path had opened up for him all of a sudden, he couldn't help but feel very happy and motivated here.\nAnd so, he ransacked classroom 3-7 in the same manner. But as he was exiting the room, his steps came to an abrupt halt. Yun Seora was standing in front of the doorway.\nHer gaze alternated between the wide-open door of a locker and her map, before shifting her gaze upwards to Seol. Although her face still more or less remained impassive as before, her eyes kept blinking nonstop. Inexplicably, Seol felt a wee bit scared, all of a sudden.\n“….”\n“….”\nFor some unknown reason, he even felt like he did something he shouldn't have and become a criminal in the process.\n'…Maybe, I should leave 3-8 alone….'\nHe carefully sidestepped past Yun Seora and headed off to 3-9. His steps were quick and urgent, as the feeling of apologetic guilt pricked him.\nHowever, while walking past 3-8…. He couldn't understand why Yun Seora chose to follow him instead of stopping by the classroom.\nSeol was now beset with a sense of awkwardness and began to run. Sure enough, he could hear hurried footsteps following him from behind. Now genuinely flustered, Seol quickly entered classroom 3-9.\n[Classroom 3-9, on top of the teacher's podium, x3]\n[Classroom 3-9, above the TV cabinet, x1]\nWhile Seol was pocketing the coins from the podium, Yun Seora charged forward as fast as an infantryman attacking his enemy and pounced on the TV cabinet. By the time Seol shifted his gaze towards her direction, her arm was already shooting up towards the top of the cabinet.\n“….Ah.”\nUnfortunately for her, her hand couldn't quite reach up there.\nThe TV cabinet itself was rather huge, and it easily exceeded two meters in height. In other words, it was tall enough to nearly touch the ceiling. It was obvious that Yun Seora and her height of around the middle of 160 cm would never reach up there.\n….Even when she tried to stand on one foot,\n….Even when she stood on tiptoes with both of her heels leaving the ground,\n….Even when she jumped up and down on her not-so-new shoes.\n….Her hand only swung around the empty air, so close and yet so far.\nShe kept doing that for a while. She could've just used a desk or a chair to stand higher, but….\nSeol found her gasping and sweating while struggling like that very funny and adorable, and a short laughter broke out from his lips.\n“Fu…. Ahahaha….”\nHer movements came to a standstill.\nSeol hurriedly covered his mouth up, but it was too late by then. Yun Seora's head robotically turned around to face him, her expression dazed and lost.\nSeol felt incredibly apologetic once more. He had no excuses to offer. Even though his personality might be on the wrong side of being blunt, he still knew he had made a big mistake just now.\nIndeed, he knew that very well, yet…..\nSeol had to summon every ounce of willpower to suppress the laughter trying to explode out of his mouth. Should he say that the dam had been well and truly burst open? Her reactions of now were utterly, comically different to her normally indifferent expressions. He couldn’t help but find it incredibly funny.\nDidn't one of the old sayings go along the lines of, 'laughter would get progressively harder to block the more you try?'\n'What should I do now?'\nSeol felt like he'd explode in a fit of laughter if he tried to say something now. He gulped in lots of air, and while suppressing his laughter in the same way one would hold his breath, walked to the TV cabinet. He retrieved the coin and took a quick glance at her.\n'What now? Why is she being so resentful like that?'\nSeol carefully presented the recovered coin to her. She briefly looked at it resting on his palm before staring at him without saying anything. However, she seemed to be implying, 'Are you pitying me right now?'\n“….”\n“….”\nA strange but awkward silence flowed between them. Seol was on the brink of going crazy. She needed to either take the damn coin or leave it, but the main thing was that she needed to make up her mind right now and leave the classroom so he'd get to finally break down and laugh his head off. Trying to suppress this laughter was killing him inside.\n“T-Take it….”\nIn the end, Seol couldn't endure it and opened his mouth with great difficulty. However….\n“…Ta, tak, tak, tahahahahahaha!!!”\nThe laughter exploded out of his mouth even though he inwardly went, ‘Oh, crap!’\n“No, wait! I mean, no! Take, ta, tahahaha….”\nYun Seora's complexion, visible through his desperately waving hands, was incomparably pale.\nNow that he finally let the unstoppable laughter out of his system, the unavoidable reality hit him.\nYun Seora seemed rather nonplussed. Although her gaze was slightly lowered, she maintained that impassive expression of hers.\n'She's feeling okay, I guess?'\nJust as Seol was feeling relieved inwardly…\nSniff.\n….He could hear a soft sniffle through her nose. Although the amount was small, her upturned eyes were wet with tears.\nIt seemed that her pride had been wounded. Her breathing became imperceptibly faster, and her facial muscles began twitching as well. Now that Seol took a closer look, she was also biting her lips ever so slightly.\nShe eventually wiped her eyes and turned on her heels to leave.\n“Uhm….”\nSeol continued to watch the silently departing back of Yun Seora, the coin still resting on top of his palm.\n*\nOn the fifth floor, just after the treasure hunt commenced.\nKang Seok directed his followers into the bathroom and locked the door behind him.\n“What's the matter? ….Is it urgent? We gotta find those coins quickly, you know!”\nHearing Yi Hyungsik's words, Kang Seok's lips formed a wry smile.\n“What are you so worried about? We can start looking for them later. Or just take it from those who have found some already.”\n“You want to steal them?”\n“Obviously.”\nAfter hearing Kang Seok's declaration, Yi Hyungsik rubbed his nose. Perhaps still feeling the brunt of the pain experienced not too long ago, a low groan leaked out of his lips. Jeong Minwoo's complexion wasn't so good either.\n“That bastard wouldn't sit still though….”\n“That's right. I think it'll be better for us to collect them the normal way.”\nKang Seok raised his voice in anger after hearing the pathetic replies from his two lackeys.\n“Fuck me, you get hit only once and are now shivering like some scared cats? Why don't you just chop off your balls right now? Idiots!”\n“….”\n“Eh? What's the matter with you two? Are you going to take that shit lying down? Really now?”\n“B-But….!”\n“I can't let this shit go. I gotta pay him back with interest. 10 times, no, 100 times more. Isn't that how human nature works?”\n“…You have a plan or something?”\nJeong Minwoo asked, still sounding not entirely convinced. Kang Seok licked his lips in a rather ominous manner, rechecked that the door was locked, and then beckoned his lackeys to come closer.\n“Come on closer.”\nYi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo came closer and paid attention.\n“We will also go and collect those coins. We will do our best, right until midnight. Got it?”\n“Uhm?”\n“Keep listening, because this is where it will get interesting.”\nKang Seok lowered his voice to a whisper and explained his plan to the two.\n“W-What did you say?”\nYi Hyungsik's mouth opened up wide in surprise.\n“What… But, if that happens….”\n“Keep your mouth shut.”\nKang Seok growled menacingly, causing Yi Hyungsik to promptly slam his lips shut.\n“…Is there a reason for us to go this far?”\n“Yeah, there's a fucking reason. That asshole came out swinging first, so it's only correct that we swing back even harder.”\n“But… will it even work?”\n“It's going to. Look, look!”\nSeeing Jeong Minwoo tilt his head this way and that, Kang Seok smirked deeply.\n“What do you think this is~?”\nKang Seok then pulled out two pieces of paper from his pocket and waved them in front of his lackeys' faces.\n“What's that?”\n“He's not the only one who received a starting bonus, know what I mean? If we succeed, then we'll be the ones controlling this place in no time.”\nKang Seok declared triumphantly, before slightly cocking his eyebrow.\n“….So?”\nWhile having his hands locked and fidgeting around, Jeong Minwoo shrugged his shoulders. Seeing this, Yi Hyungsik sighed out as if he couldn't help it, either.\n“Good. No need to worry about a thing, boys. We only need what, 5, 10 minutes, tops? Now you get it, don't you?”\nThe two lackeys nodded their heads. Kang Seok began gritting his teeth.\n“All we have to do is to defeat that fucker. When we grind that motherfucker to nothing, then we win.”\n*\n[Remaining time until midnight: 00: 36: 12]\nThe end of the treasure hunt was getting nearer.\nThe total number of hidden coins might have been 3000, but that didn't mean all of them could be found at once. After the coins were discovered and taken away in an area, they respawned after a short amount of time elapsed. Seol got to find that out after seeing the diary of the unknown student getting updated numerous times.\nThanks to that, Seol had to roam the fourth and fifth-floor several times, but eventually, he got to stretch his limbs in the end.\nHe felt fulfilled. He worked tirelessly and got to find almost 1600 coins in the end. Specifically, a total of 1552 of them. There were twelve survivors participating in the hunt, so this was the same as him monopolizing over half of the available coins.\n'I should probably go there now.'\nAfter lightly tapping his bag, Seol headed upstairs. If he wanted to, he could keep finding the coins, but he was mindful of the time needed to use the item draw machine.\nNow that cooperating with the others was out of the question, no one knew what could happen later on. So, rather than anxiously wait till it was midnight, he knew it was smart to make some kind of preparations.\nAs if others were still too busy with the treasure hunt, there was no one besides himself inside the fifth-floor library. The so-called draw machine kind of resembled one of those gacha machines[1] one could find commonly placed in front of stationery shops, the only difference being this one was somewhat larger.\n[The list of items available to draw]1. 1 coin to 9 coins: Food, daily necessities, a note from the Guide, medical supplies….2. 10 coins to 49 coins: Relief supplies, souvenirs, various maps, a letter from the maid….3. 50 coins to 99 coins: Weapons, defensive items, Survival Points, a brand new, cutting-edge smartphone….4. 100 coins: Spell balls, random coin box (contains up to 1~499 coins)5. 199 coins: Sixth-floor access key (100% odds)6. 300 coins: SPECIAL\nSeol fell into deep thought. He needed 100 coins as the usage fee, so he had to deduct that amount. And since he didn't know what would happen later, he had to reserve the amount to purchase the access key as well.\nThat left 1253 coins to play around with.\nSo, should he go for the “SPECIAL” four times, or only try that one out a couple times and get some spell balls instead?\nHe didn't think for too long.\nFirst of all, he found the actions of Kang Seok and his crew rather suspicious. They ran into each other a few times during the hunt, yet they didn't try anything, seemingly only focusing on the treasure hunt and nothing else. However, they couldn't fool his eyes.\n'I saw their colors.'\nOriginally, only Kang Seok emitted the yellowish color, but now, both Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo emitted the same yellow hue as well. In other words, he had to pay close attention to them. Since their colors were the same, it could only mean that they were cooking up something bad. So, Seol naturally chose the latter option.\nHe needed a weapon of some kind. Indeed, he needed an all-conquering ace up his sleeve that could help him out, even if he found himself stuck in the worst possible situation imaginable.\nSeol picked up the first coin, but he soon began swearing out inwardly. Why? Because he realized that manually inserting each coin one at the time was unexpectedly a lot of work, that's why.\n“Goddamn it….”\nA somewhat lengthy time later, Seol packed the drawn items into his bag while massaging his aching fingers.\nThe end result was actually quite satisfactory.\n[Random coin box: contains 81 extra coins][Spell ball: Spider Web, x1][Random coin box: contains 136 extra coins][Spell ball: Poison Fog, x1][Spell ball: Ignite, x1][Random coin box: contains 292 extra coins][Spell ball: Hydrochloric Acid, x1][SPECIAL: Mirror of Understanding, x1]\nHe was especially happy with the results of two of the random boxes. Although it couldn't be called a massive success, he'd happily call that at least a mid-level success.\nSo he still had 1061 coins remaining. Even if he went for SPECIAL twice, he'd have 162 coins left over.\nSeol decided to stop around there. This should be more than enough, but also, time was running out. As soon as the clock struck midnight, the so-called Hour of the Deceased would begin. So he should quietly return to the ‘safe zone’ and wait until midday tomorrow.\nSeol's steps as he walked down the staircase were confident yet easy going. What he didn't expect to find was that classroom 3-1 was still deserted. It was the so-called safe zone, and there were less than 10 minutes before midnight, yet not even an ant could be seen.\nSeol stood there wondering until he heard the classroom's sliding door noisily open up behind him.\n“Uh? You were here already?”\nSeol turned around while inwardly thinking, ‘Of course, people should start showing up soon.’\nThe first one to enter was Hyun Sangmin, but he didn't look so good. A short while afterwards, Shin Sang-Ah trudged inside as well.\n“What happened to you? I got nearly fucked up.”\n“M-Me too….”\n“I mean, what the hell? It's like a crazy asshole swept away everything like a hurricane. Why is it this hard to find a single damn coin?”\n“You're so right. You know, I shouldn't have been so fired up after finding a few in the beginning. I could only find 70 coins in the end.”\nShin Sang-Ah complained while massaging her feet.\n“You're worse than me though. I met the 100 coin requirement at least.”\nHyun Sangmin's voice was rather weak as well.\nSeol thought about it for a long while, before deciding to give Shin Sang-Ah 30 coins. Since he was already treating the remaining 162 as a reserve, he didn't even hesitate.\n“Uhm….?”\nShin Sang-Ah's eyes grew larger.\n“A–Are you giving these to me?”\nThe look in her eyes was already well past gratitude and into the territory of 'worshipping a savior'.\n“Wha, what the heck? 30 coins in one go?”\n“Please, take it. What, you also need some?”\n“Holy shit. How many did you manage to find?”\nSeol scratched his cheek sheepishly.\n“….Enough to survive, I guess?”\nHyun Sangmin's expression showed how dumbfounded he was before he suddenly exploded in a fit of laughter as he fell back.\n“Geez, so it was you.”\n“?”\n“I knew it. It just didn't make any sense unless someone already swooped in and picked everything clean. I seriously searched everywhere, dude….! Uh-whew, so the guilty party wasn't Yun Seora, eh.”\n“Why? What's up with Yun Seora?”\n“Mm? I thought you've realized it by now. I was thinking that she knew where all the coins were and was busy hogging them all for herself. I'm pretty sure it's not only me who thinks this way.”\nThat made sense.\nHyun Sangmin added that he was now feeling bad after inwardly slagging her off for being a selfish bitch. This led to Seol to feel an even greater sense of guilt, knowing that he had inconvenienced everyone else, albeit it wasn't his intention to begin with.\n[The Hour of the Deceased will commence from this point on.]\nFinally, midnight arrived. As if the three of them had made a promise beforehand, they closed their mouths shut at the same time. However, there were only the three of them in the base even now.\n“Where's everyone?”\n“It's obvious, isn't it?”\nHyun Sangmin answered Seol's query while fishing out a cigarette.\n“Even I was wondering whether I should return or not. In any case, I found 100 coins, so I decided to come back here, but…. Others probably aren't thinking the same way.”\n“You think so?”\n“Yeah. They are probably like, just a bit more, a bit more and then…. They should be going crazy trying to find enough for the usage fee alone. And those trying to revive the dead, well, it seems that they don't even care anymore.”\nSo that's how it was.\nAlthough not as much as Seol, Yun Seora must've found a considerable number of coins for herself. What with the two of them sweeping away the majority of the available coins, there shouldn't be a lot remaining right about now.\nSo it was as obvious as daylight that the competition would only get worse. Seol never expected things to devolve in this manner while he was busy collecting the coins. No, he didn't even bother to think about it at all.\n“Oh well. If they are worried about their lives, I'm sure they'll eventually show up sooner or later.”\nHyun Sangmin murmured while sucking on his cigarette.\n“What… are you going to do?”\nShin Sang-Ah asked while cautiously studying Seol's reaction.\nSeol felt contradicting emotions in his mind. He didn't care much about Kang Seok and his crew, but when he thought about Yun Seora and Yi Sungjin, he couldn't help but feel uncomfortable.\n“I guess… I should find the ones that I can.”\n“Yes. Let me help you.”\nShin Sang-Ah agreed immediately while her expressions showed how relieved she was. Seeing this, Seol became ever so slightly curious about her Status window. And so, just as he was about to take a peek into it….\n“Oww, goddamn it.”\n….Hyun Sangmin slowly stood up from his seat.\n“I don't like this at all, but…. Yeah, I will lend a helping hand too. A promise is a promise, right?”\nHe spoke as if letting out a long groan and playfully pointed towards the door with his chin.\n“Shall we go, Leader?”\n….It happened then.\n\n[1] A type of vending machine that typically dispenses capsuled toys"

    "content": "The fifth floor.\nAt the end of a corridor lined with various classrooms, there was a laboratory. Not one ray of light could escape from the resolutely-shut front door to the lab— only the soft rustling noises managed to intermittently leak out.\nA certain teen boy was currently rummaging through the lab's interior. He cleared away the chemistry sets and other glass apparatuses on top of the tables and pulled out all of the books stored on the bookshelves. He was desperately searching for something.\nBut as time continued to tick by, the signs of anxiety slowly but surely crept into every little action he performed.\nKiik.\nSuddenly, there was a noise.\nHowever, the teen boy, Yi Sungjin, couldn't hear it due to the fact that he was turning a table upside down at that very moment. He intensely glared at and looked through all the fallen and shattered laboratory apparatuses. And he moved on, not even slowing down briefly to express his disappointment. He continued to mutter, ‘Coins, I need to find more coins.’\nHe deliberately didn't switch on the light. He thought that it'd be easier to spot those clear-yellow coins if the surroundings were darker.\nTak…. Tak….\nAgain, there were foreign noises. It was soft and low enough to miss if one didn't pay attention.\nYi Sungjin didn't pay any attention. His mind was full of thoughts of reviving his dead sister, Yi Seol-Ah. The Guide definitely said it— he would be able to bring his sister back to life if he got to amass lots of coins.\n“Noona….”\nThe mental shock he received after witnessing the dead Yi Seol-Ah being pulled out was truly enormous. Although everything below her waist remained relatively fine, her upper torso was ripped to shreds and not much of her remained. Just thinking about his undeservedly murdered sister, his body seemingly shook off any hints of growing fatigue and regained its vigor once more.\nIt was said that the heavens would help those who helped themselves, and he soon discovered an object gleaming softly inside a sink. Yi Sungjin's eyes shot wide open and he reflexively reached out.\nUnfortunately…. he was in too much of a hurry.\n“Ah!”\nThe coin that he worked so hard to find, slipped out of his grasp and fell to the floor. It rolled and slid under the desk. The boy instantly jumped down and reached out with all his might, finally catching the wayward coin before it disappeared for good. Only then did he catch his breath again.\nOutside the lab's windows, the world had become pitch dark. Only the cold, uncaring moonlight seeped through the glass and faintly illuminated the interior.\n“Whew….”\nIt was only one coin, but this was clear evidence that his concerted effort was not in vain.\nTime was already well past midnight, yet he still had a long road ahead. He didn't have the time to worry about the Hour of Deceased. No, he had to find more coins. Lots more. Yi Sungjin clenched the lone coin in his hand tightly and gritted his teeth.\nTak….! Tak….!\nYi Sungjin was about to push himself up from the floor but froze up instantly when he heard the noise. The noise seemed to brush by his senses, perhaps tauntingly calling out to him. His arms became tense and taut. His hands pressing down on the floor felt the deathly chill and goosebumps spread all over him.\nIn an instant, fifty thousand different thoughts raced past his brain. The sixteen-and-a-bit-year-old teen boy very slowly and cautiously raised his head. And when his sights were raised from the ash-colored floor just a tad, he forgot to breathe.\nJust below the desk, he could see a pair of small feet, and above them, long, shapely legs. Legs, that trembled and stuttered as if they might falter at any moment.\nYi Sungjin was about to scream, but his eyes opened wider before his mouth could leak out a sound. Although he only saw the lower half, he found it rather familiar somehow. And when he recognized the blue skirt with dried blood on it, the boy's eyes opened even wider.\n“N–Noona!?”\nThe stuttering legs stopped. And they slowly spun around as if they were looking for someone.\n“Wwwwhhhheeeerrrreee…..”\nThe voice sounded awful and Yi Sungjin was immediately repulsed by it, but to him, that wasn't important. He stood right up and….\n“Noona? Is it you, Noona!? I'm here! N….”\n…But he couldn't finish what he wanted to say.\nThe figure that had its back towards him and was slowly turning around was quite similar to Yi Seol-Ah. It had the same long flowing hair, and, and….\n“N–Noona….?”\nSomething was wrong. Very wrong. He couldn't put his finger on it. Yet, this figure resembled his older sister so much….\nYi Sungjin's instincts were overcome with this hard to explain terror.\n“Ssssuuuunnngggg-----Jjjjjiiiinnnn---aaahhh….. Hhhhuuuu…..”\nPlop.\nSuddenly, her neck skin wobbled and stretched like an empty sack. Only then did the boy understand the reason for the sense of disharmony— the ratio of her body parts didn't quite match up.\n“N–Noona….”\nHe wanted to ask. He desperately wanted to ask why her body looked like that. He desperately wanted to ask if she was really his sister. However, his voice refused to come out.\n“Hhhhuuuurrrryyyy…..”\nAs if this thing wanted to tell him something, the abrasive and dirty voice continued to leak out. ‘She’ had completely turned around now and was facing him, and when Yi Sungjin saw the empty eye sockets, his deeply-held breaths exploded out from his lungs.\n“Euh-hark!!!”\nWould stitching together several worn-out mops resemble that thing? Within the many holes found on its skin, dried-up clumps of blood and rotting meat scraps were seemingly shoved in together.\nThe meshed and torn flesh seemed to have hardened after the bits were forced together to their supposedly correct destinations, while the ripped skin seemed like it was sewn back together and was draped over whatever was underneath. It was truly a hellish, nightmarish appearance.\nPiecing together the torn-away bits of limbs and flesh one by one would probably net a better looking, more palatable result than this.\n“Euh, uwaaaaahhh!!”\nYi Sungjin unconsciously stumbled back, until his heels got entangled and he fell down on his butt. His legs madly kicked the air as he tried to widen the gap between himself and that thing.\nIt was then that the comparatively-normal looking legs stopped approaching him. ‘Her’ misaligned jaw that looked like it might fall off at any given moment began trembling up and down.\n“L, llliiisssttteeennn… Hhhuuurrryyy….”\nYi Sungjin's mind fell further into disarray. He thought that he'd be dead meat by now, yet why did this creature stop advancing? And, what was it trying to say to him?\nIt was here that a crazy thought popped up in his mind. He summoned what little courage he could.\n“…Is, is it you, Noona?”\n“….”\n“Noona? Really? It is you, Noona!?”\n“…Hhhuuurrryyy…. Ssstttaaannnddd….”\n“...Hurry? Stand?”\nWhile keeping his gaze firmly fixed on the creature, Yi Sungjin slowly got back up.\n“Gggooo…. ooouuutttsssiiideee…. Fffiiinnnddd….”\n“Go outside? Find? You mean coins? Are you talking about coins? Don't worry. I, I haven't given up, and I'm still looking for them! I'll definitely bring you back….”\nThe thing shook its head with some difficulty. It was as if it was saying that's not it.\n“Iiittt…. cccooommmiiinnnggg…. Sssooooonnn…”\nIt weakly raised an arm somehow and pointed at the door.\n“Cccooommmiiinnnggg…. ttthhheeeyyy aaarrreee…..”\nAlthough it was hard to understand what it was saying, the boy still got to realize something. ‘She’ was saying he needed to get out before something else showed up.\n“Noona!! It is you, right!?”\n“….”\n“I'll definitely bring you back to life!! That is why….”\n“Sssuuunnnggg-----Jjjiiinnn---aaahhh….”\nYi Sungjin's tearful voice seemingly caused the thing's shoulders to tremble as well. From its empty eye sockets, blood-colored liquid slowly oozed out.\n“Mmmuuusssttt….llliiivvveee…. Oookkkaaayyy…”\nIt was then.\nUwwwaaaahhhhccckk!!!\nAn ear-shattering scream coming from somewhere outside the lab shook the corridor hard.\n*\n“Mom!?”\nShin Sang-Ah jumped up in fright. Seol and Hyun Sangmin too wordlessly stared at each other.\n“….Hey man, did you hear that?”\nSeol nodded his head.\n“Goddamn it! Why the hell can't they just come back after finding enough for themselves!?”\n“Where did that come from?”\n“Dunno. Could be from the fifth floor….”\nHyun Sangmin took off his cap and scratched his head.\nSeol carefully slid open the door. The darkened corridor seemed rather ominous and eerie.\nAlthough he had exited from the classroom, Seol had no idea what he should do now, since things were happening seemingly out of the blue. In the end, he chose to rely on his Nine Eyes once more.\nThe entire fourth-floor corridor was bathed in a green hue. Seeing this, Seol's gut feeling told him that the scream came from the fifth floor.\nThe three of them quickly climbed up the stairs. But soon after arriving on the fifth floor, they nearly collided into a teen boy running through the corridor. It was Yi Sungjin, and when he saw it was Seol, the boy's eyes opened wide.\n“Mister Yi Sungjin? What's going on?”\n“H–Hyung!!”\nYi Sungjin suddenly grabbed Seol tightly.\n“I, I saw her!! I saw Noona just now!!”\n“Your noona!?”\nBut, how could that be? Yi Seol-Ah was already dead. She was the first one to lose her life back in the assembly hall, after all. Seol carefully appraised the kid, but he didn't seem to be suffering from any form of mental duress.\nSeeing Seol's expression, Yi Sungjin quickly shook his head.\n“No, no! Hang on! It's definitely her! Her hair, her dress, everything….”\nYi Sungjin sounded frantic and confused, but his words did make Seol think for a minute. Then, a thought of ‘could it be?’ brushed past his brain.\n“Was it really Yi Seol-Ah?”\n“Yes!! Her…. appearance, it was a bit weird, but, but, she told me to quickly get out of there, and….”\n‘You son of a….’ Seol somehow managed to swallow down the rising tide of curse words.\n'The so-called Deceased are actually the people who died earlier in the day, aren't they?'\nIf what Yi Sungjin said was correct, then this could be the only explanation.\n[The lock of the sixth-floor entrance has been disabled.]\n[The gate will be activated in 30 minutes' time.]\n[The second-floor metal barriers have been disabled.]\nIt was then that alarm bells began ringing out loudly from their smartphones.\n“W–what the hell?”\nHyun Sangmin cried out in shock after checking out these rather unexpected messages.\n“What the fuck!! Which insane motherfucker did this!?”\n“What, what happened?”\nShin Sang-Ah asked Seol, but obviously, he too had no idea. Only that, his gut feeling was busy telling him that this wasn't the end, and there was more trouble yet to come.\n'No. It'll be fine.'\nThe situation had suddenly turned a little chaotic, but Seol quietly controlled his emotions to calm them down. Running around like a headless chicken would only intensify the level of confusion. Besides, didn't he already make preparations for events such as this one?\nFor now, he decided to put aside the unanswered questions as there was something he needed to confirm first. Although he thought that there was a possibility that his suspicions might not be correct.\n“Were you the one screaming just now, Yi Sungjin?”\n“Eh? N–No. Not me. Right, I also came here after hearing that….”\n“I, I thought it was a woman's voice….”\nShin Sang-Ah anxiously spoke up.\n“In any case, it's not this kid, so what are we going to do next?”\nHyun Sangmin gritted his teeth.\n“If we're going to search, then we should split up. Or, we go back right now.”\nSeol had found one of the two people on his mind, so going back now to classroom 3-1, the safe zone, didn't sound like a bad idea.\n“How about we split up into two groups of two and three? I mean, things could get dangerous.”\nSeol was going to suggest going back, but then, Yi Sungjin took the initiative first and voiced his opinion. Seol looked at the boy with a surprised expression, and Yi Sungjin became somewhat sheepish.\n“Ohh, I, uh… I also want to help you.”\n“It's past midnight, thus things will definitely get dangerous. Also, the sixth-floor access has been granted as well. Returning to the safe zone might not be such a bad idea.”\n“No. It's just that, I think my noona wanted me to find something….”\nAlthough he said that, Yi Sungjin's voice suggested that he wasn't entirely convinced of it himself.\n'Find something?'\nSeol's gaze sharpened. The surroundings became dyed in green. However, the color from one single spot dissipated almost immediately. The spot with no color whatsoever was the girl's toilet.\nThe light was switched off inside the toilet, but Seol confirmed a spot of blood on the floor right in front of the door. He slowly pushed it open. As if his senses were already familiarised with it, his nose reacted to the faint whiff of blood in the air.\nBy turning on the light, the group could see the interior of the bathroom quite clearly.\n“Yun Seora?”\nThe figure collapsed on the bathroom floor was none other than Yun Seora. Her huddled and crumpled body was shaking and convulsing uncontrollably.\nSeol got closer to her and ended up frowning deeply from what he saw. Even Hyun Sangmin issued a stunned gasp.\n“What… What happened to her arm…?”\nIt was just as he said— Yun Seora's right forearm was completely mangled. As if someone had stabbed a knife and then went to town on the limb, the flesh on her arm was utterly torn up and destroyed. The bleeding was quite considerable too, and even her bones were visible to the naked eye.\n“Miss Yun Seora? Miss Yun Seora!!”\nSeol called out her name, but she didn't respond, simply convulsing over and over again.\n“Please, move aside!”\nShin Sang-Ah hurriedly knelt down and took off her shirt. She ripped her top up, then proceeded to wrap the fabric around Yun Seora's shoulder and under her arm, and then securely tightened it. Her movements were well-practiced and quick as if she had performed actions like this countless times before. She then pushed open Yun Seora's eyelids and checked her eyes. A deep frown etched on her forehead.\n“She's going through a shock. She will die soon if we let her be like this.”\n“S–she will die!?”\n“Yes! We need to do something! Anything!”\nShin Sang-Ah shouted out while repeatedly opening and closing Yun Seora's hand. However, Hyun Sangmin was comparatively calm as he spoke up.\n“Since you’ve been on the treasure hunt for a while, you should know it. There ain't no infirmary on either the fourth or the fifth floor.”\n“The item draw.”\nSeol spoke up and the attention of the three was rapidly drawn to him. Now that they thought about it, 'medical supplies' was one of the listed items on the draw machine.\n“What do we need to draw from there?”\nOnly after asking this question, Seol realized that it was the wrong one. From the onset, no one knew what would come out of the machine.\n“I'll go and bring whatever comes out.”\nSeol stood up while slinging his bag over his shoulder.\n“What? You going alone?”\n“What's the matter?”\n“Let's not do it that way. How about this? This kiddo here and Miss will move Yun Seora over to the safe zone. Meanwhile, you spin that damn draw machine, and if we think we got the right crap, I'll take it back to the safe zone. I'll act as the go-between if need be.”\nSeol found this suggestion quite logical, so although he knew that time was of the essence, he still nodded his head in appreciation. He was inwardly surprised as well— now that the metal barriers on the second floor were gone, that Gaekgwi monster would definitely show up sooner or later. Even then, Hyun Sangmin was keeping his promise.\n“Let's hurry up!”\nHyun Sangmin pushed Seol's back.\nEntrusting Yun Seora to the remaining two, Seol and Hyun Sangmin headed straight to the library. Perhaps fortunately, they didn't run into the Deceased or the other people.\nUnfortunately though, the medical supplies didn't want to come out. They got to draw plenty of food and daily necessities. They even ended up receiving the 'note from the Guide'. Sometime later, all they had to show for their effort was a couple of rolls of gauze, a bottle of antiseptic, some ointments, and a few other things. They were neither here nor there.\n“Let me just take these along for now. What about you?”\n“Go on ahead.”\n“Okay. Don't strain yourself, though. Ah, right. As soon as I deliver these, I'll come back here right away. If I don't show up within two minutes, then that means something bad has happened to me.”\n“Don't worry, I'll rescue you.”\n“Hah! Well, thanks for the sentiment, but I'm not playing here. I'm being serious.”\nHyun Sangmin was indeed dead serious, and he left the library like a streak of lightning.\nSeol concentrated on drawing from the machine. He was quite confident that he'd be able to kill this Gaekgwi monster if it showed up. Right now, he wanted to procure medical supplies if it meant he could help just a bit more.\nIf Yun Seora died, then that would be the end of the road there.\nHe thought like this and continued to move his hands without rest until his movements suddenly came to a halt.\n'….Why am I doing this?'\nShe was a complete stranger to him. So what did it matter if she died or not? Sure, it would be a pity if she did die, but was there a reason for him to go this far? While even wasting his hard-earned coins?\nHe couldn't understand it. He thought that it'd be nice if he could activate Future Vision right about now. Seol hesitated, yet returned to spinning the draw machine.\nAnd so, he finally got his hands on some rolls of compression bandages, a hemostat, as well as vials of morphine. But then….\nSeol realized that something was off. He thought that it was already well past the two-minute mark, yet Hyun Sangmin hadn't returned.\n“….”\nSeol felt a certain sense of anxiety creeping in— after all, he thought that Hyun Sangmin was joking around and thus, didn't pay much attention back then.\nNow that he more or less got what he needed, Seol put them all in his bag and left the library.\nWhen he climbed down the staircase and arrived on the fourth floor, he ended up running into quite an unexpected sight.\n"

    "content": "Seven people, consisting of Shin Sang-Ah, Yi Sungjin, Hyun Sangmin, and Yun Seora, as well as the three people Seol shared food with earlier on, were standing in the corridor right outside classroom 3-2. They seemed to be unable to enter the safe zone.\nThat wasn't the end, however.\nSeol found three rather familiar figures outside classroom 3-1. Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo stood triumphantly, while Kang Seok was sitting on a chair, looking quite relaxed and pleased with himself.\n“You finally showed up.”\nKang Seok raised his hand and greeted Seol. Ignoring him, Seol walked closer and spotted Hyun Sangmin's darkened expression. Anger was evident on his face as well. Shin Sang-Ah also looked like she'd just had about enough of those three, too.\n“….They say it's a spell that restricts access.”\nHyun Sangmin glanced at Seol and groaned out.\n'A spell that can restrict access?'\nJust as he finished thinking this, Seol's steps came to a halt. No, that wasn't quite right— he couldn't go forward as if there was an invisible wall blocking his progress.\nSeol lightly tapped on the seemingly empty air. Knock, knock. There was nothing in front of him, yet the sensation of knocking on a cement wall was transmitted to his hand.\n“You're wasting your time. You see, I got this as a starting bonus. No one can enter without my permission.”\nKang Seok slowly fidgeted around with his fingers. There was a half-torn piece of paper held between his index and middle finger.\n“You haven't forgotten that my Mark was silver, right? Mister high-and-mighty Gold Mark.”\nKang Seok giggled insidiously. Seol frowned slightly, instead.\n“You opened the door to the sixth floor, didn't you?”\n“Bingo.”\n“And why?”\n“Mm? I got the key through the drawing machine. Don't you know that you will definitely receive the key if you spend 199 coins?”\nOf course, Seol knew that. But, he was curious about the reason why Kang Seok would waste his coins getting that key in the first place. After all, what with Seol and Yun Seora taking away almost all the coins, Kang Seok and his goons couldn't have had the easiest time searching for the coins themselves.\nIt would have been tough just finding enough for their gate usage fee, so why….\n“Ahh….”\nIt was then, a hypothesis formed in Seol's head. He reflexively turned his head around to look behind him— at the unconscious Yun Seora.\n“Yup, as expected! I knew you were a smart guy!”\nKang Seok exclaimed in a display of pleasant surprise.\n“Actually, I have to admit that this was a gamble with low odds of success. I mean, in order for us to succeed, two things had to happen, you know what I mean? If you had chosen never to leave this safe zone in the first place, then my plan would've been all for nothing.”\n“What are you saying?”\n“However, I definitely knew you'd crawl out of here. Seriously now, a nice gentleman like you wouldn't just sit still on your ass after hearing that loud scream, am I right?”\n“….”\n“As for Yun Seora… Well, I was planning to approach her when the time was right, but for some reason, she was getting really fired up trying to find more coins. Oh, well! It was a good thing for us in the end, so it doesn't matter, right?”\nHearing this, the pieces finally fell to their intended places.\nThe first step of Kang Seok's plan was to get the sixth-floor access key. With three of them working together, finding 199 coins wouldn't have been that difficult.\nAfter acquiring the key, Kang Seok kept a close eye on the situation.\nFrom the very beginning, he never planned to hit Seol. No, he planned to attack Yun Seora the moment she revealed that she was in possession of the map.\nThe timing was important, but the main variable was still Yun Seora. Kang Seok had to try something, anything to separate her from Seol.\nThe original plan was to have one of their members assault either Yi Sungjin or some other poor sucker to draw Seol away, and in the meantime, the remaining two would attack the isolated Yun Seora. Her personality meant that even if there was some kind of an incident unfolding somewhere, she'd not care and thus, not make a move herself.\nHowever, Yun Seora was focused on finding more coins well beyond the midnight mark. How could this situation be any better for Kang Seok and his goons?\nSo, the trio assaulted Yun Seora as she entered the girl's restroom. After robbing her of her coins, they went to the sixth floor before Seol reached the bathroom, and opened the door. Then, when Seol was still on the fifth floor, they came back down to the safe area and activated the restriction spell.\n“All of you have lost your damned minds!”\nShin Sang-Ah loudly swore at them.\n“You insane bastards! You crippled a person to this degree, just for some measly coins?”\n“Nope~ That wasn't my original intention. I just wanted to knock her out. I swear that was all.”\nKang Seok defended himself as if he was being wrongly accused of the crime.\n“But then, that girl was so damn persistent, you know what I mean? She grabbed onto the bag and didn't want to give it up, and that really pissed me off. So, that's why….”\nThe end of Kang Seok's sentence trailed off; Jeong Minwoo standing next to him giggled unsightly, and from seemingly out of nowhere, produced a dagger and performed a stabbing motion in the air. He too was an Invited, albeit as a Bronze Mark.\nKKKIIIEEEHHHH—!!!\nWith an exquisite ill-timing, a devilish roar resounded out from the distance. The complexions of almost everyone present paled. The very first monster they encountered upon the start of this journey, the one that gave them such a nightmare— the Gaekgwi was climbing up to where they were at this precise moment.\n“Wow! Sounds like that thing is really pissed off, isn't it? Oh, well. It's been locked out down below all this time, so there's that.”\nKang Seok and his two cronies looked extremely relaxed.\n“If you're waiting for the end of this spell's duration…. Well, I feel like I should inform you right now, that you all should just give up.”\n“Are you saying it'll last forever?”\n“No ways. It's not that crazy of a cheat item. Not only the duration, but the size of the effective area is limited, actually. If I were to increase the area to its maximum permitted width, then it'll probably last around 8 minutes, tops? …But what do you think will happen if I only keep the area to half its maximum size? Like, only around this part of the corridor.”\nKang Seok pointed once each towards the safe zone's front and rear entrances. Seol didn't reply. There was no need to after all; Kang Seok was implying that, when the spell's covered area decreased in size, the duration of the spell would increase instead.\n“With that Gaekgwi coming up, you wouldn't be able to go to the sixth floor yourself, though?”\n“Oh, that? You don't have to worry. You see, I'm a really lucky bastard. Look here.”\nKang Seok pulled out another piece of paper and waved it around the air.\n“See? I've got another paper talisman with a spell written on it~!”\nSeeing how he was playfully teasing Seol and others like that, it seemed this must've been his natural-born talent. Seol couldn't help but think that the reason the bastard turned out this way was all thanks to suffering a bad prenatal development or something similar.\n“Please! Let us in!”\nSomeone behind Seol shouted out. It was the young man who tried to sneakily ask Seol to revive his dead friend, right before the treasure hunt commenced.\n“Mm?”\n“I, I haven't done anything wrong to you, have I?”\nHearing that, Seol couldn't help but chuckle bitterly.\n'Are you trying to imply that I did something wrong then?'\nForming a fake expression that screamed “I didn't think about that!”, Kang Seok opened his eyes wide and began rubbing his chin in a show of deep deliberation. Then, as if he was being a benevolent benefactor, he murmured rather loudly.\n“Yes, indeed…. It could be so. I'm sure it's unfair to you like this. Fine! Good, good! You, you, and you. You three, I'll grant entry.”\nThe trio glanced at each other, and then without any hesitation, ran forward. It was a repeat of the time when they were entering the second-floor safe zone as soon as the metal barrier was lowered. Only after rushing inside the safe zone did they begin spitting out sighs of relief.\nAnd so, the moment Kang Seok had been waiting for finally came. He gazed at the others who remained outside the barrier with a relaxed smile.\n'Huh….'\nSeol inwardly issued a disappointed groan. It seemed that the lessons taught on the second floor weren't enough for these idiots.\n'It's a good thing that I made preparations.'\nSeol slowly reached inside his pockets, getting ready to finish this nonsense once and for all; but, before he could….\n“So, what about you, little guy? Or you, Hyun Sangmin?”\nSeol's hand stopped just before he could grasp the spell balls. It was unknown what he was thinking at the moment while he withdrew his empty hand from the pocket.\n“You wanna die like this? Hey, you want to die to that Gaekgwi monster, the one that murdered your pretty and kind sister? Siblings, eh? Is it like, 'get one and you get another' kinda deal?”\n“I, I….”\n“Hey, man! Miss Yi Seol-Ah must be turning in her grave. I'm pretty sure she's fervently praying for me to save your hide right now.”\nKang Seok confirmed that Yi Sungjin was trembling like a leaf, and then shifted his attention to Hyun Sangmin.\n“And you… You did what you could already, right? No, wait a minute— could it be that you're feeling a guilty conscience or something? What the? I thought you were a realistic bastard like me? Was I wrong?”\n“….”\n“Just come in already. There ain't nobody here to tell you shit.”\nKang Seok's words were as slick and seductive as the whispers of a viper. After hearing those persuasive words, Hyun Sangmin and Yi Sungjin kept staring at each other before shifting their gaze to a single man.\nHowever, Seol simply stood there in silence.\nThe first one to make his move was Yi Sungjin. He resolutely shut his mouth and trudged onwards. He walked past the invisible barrier and entered the safe zone.\n“Keke…. Still so young, yet so impressively decisive. Very good. You could even become a general in the future.”\nKang Seok lightly tapped on the youth's shoulder. The boy didn't say anything and entered the classroom.\n“However, you are more loyal than you look, aren't you, Hyun Sangmin?”\nEven then, Seol didn't show any response. Seeing this, Hyun Sangmin licked his lips regretfully and pulled his cap low. After spitting out a low groan, he began moving as well.\n“….Sorry.”\n….After leaving behind that single word.\n“Oh, hang on. How about giving me a smoke first?”\nKang Seok stopped Hyun Sangmin before the latter could enter the barrier.\n“Don't forget the light.”\nOnly after Hyun Sangmin personally lit the cigarette for Kang Seok, was he allowed to enter. Kang Seok sucked in the cigarette smoke once; he then proceeded to feign shock after 'finding' Shin Sang-Ah standing there.\n“What's the matter with you now? Did you become an exhibitionist all of a sudden after taking your pants off just once?”\nShin Sang-Ah gritted her teeth. Yi Sungjin and Hyun Sangmin's desertion was quite shocking, but there was a far graver matter of her own safety to worry about here. Thinking back to the confrontation that happened in the assembly hall, and the humiliation she had to suffer on the second floor, she just knew there was no way Kang Seok would make things easy for her now.\nHowever, Kang Seok proceeded to shatter her expectations as if he was trying to show off.\n“Hey, now! I was just joking, you know. Just a joke. I can tell that you ripped your shirt to stem Yun Seora's blood loss. That is commendable. But still, you keep standing there and you might come down with the flu, you know?”\nKang Seok then took off his cardigan and pushed it towards Shin Sang-Ah's direction. He waved it around slowly as if telling her to come and take it. She couldn't help but grow suspicious.\n“You, doing this again….!”\n“Nope. I'm not trying to lead you on. I promise.”\n“But, why….?”\n“Stop trying to make me say the obvious things. Take this and put it on, already. Don't you get it?”\n“….Huh?”\n“Man, this lady is really slow on the uptake, huh. I'm saying, you can also enter. Do I have to spell it out for you too?”\nShin Sang-Ah lightly swallowed her saliva. Why was he suddenly acting like this?\nShe could just about understand the reason why— most likely, they must've held a deep grudge against Seol, all because of what happened on the second floor.\nPowerful indecision gripped her at that moment. Meanwhile, Seol still showed no signs of movement.\nShin Sang-Ah stood between Seol and Kang Seok as she weighed her options before a strange light flashed on her face for the briefest of brief moments. And then….\n“Argh, my arm hurts.”\nJust as Kang Seok lowered the offered cardigan just a tad, she moved her feet.\n“That's right. That's right.”\nShe took a quick glance at Seol a couple of times, but her feet never stopped moving. Before long, she crossed the barrier. A strange smile formed on Kang Seok's face.\n“Oh? So you really came, eh?”\n“What do you mean….?”\n“No, no. You did well. Take this before my arm falls off, will you?”\nKang Seok raised a small fuss while waving the cardigan around. Shin Sang-Ah glanced at Seol one more time, before reaching out. Just as her hand touched the offered clothing though, Kang Seok suddenly grabbed her arm and pulled her in close.\n“Mommy!?”\nLike someone falling face first, she fell forward and ended up in the still-seated Kang Seok's embrace.\n“You like looking for your mom a lot, don't you?”\n“W-what are you doing!?”\n“Stay still, will you? You came here knowing this would happen already.”\n“I, I….!”\nThud, thud…\nThe low vibration from the floors below continued to get closer. Shin Sang-Ah's stiff body flinched ever so slightly. Kang Seok's hand lightly patted her back, then slowly crept lower, past her slender waistline and eventually arrived at her petite, round rump.\n“Or…. You'd rather go back outside?”\nShe began to tremble even more when Kang Seok whispered in her ear. Gradually, all strength seemed to seep out from her. Even when he began roughly kneading her butt like rice dough, Shin Sang-Ah didn't mount any form of resistance.\n“Now, do you feel like listening to what I'm saying?”\n“….”\n“You don't want to answer?”\n“…Y-yes…”\nWhen Shin Sang-Ah replied with honorifics, Kang Seok's complexion brightened to reflect his happiness.\n“Uh-whew. My little bitch, look how soft and fluffy your ass is.”\nSlap, slap.\nKang Seok lightly slapped her rear, causing Shin Sang-Ah to squeeze her eyes shut. Quite surprisingly though, she then carefully wrapped her arms around Kang Seok's back and dug deeper into his embrace. Seeing this, Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo wolf-whistled quite loudly. Kang Seok burst out in boisterous laughter when she began gently rubbing her cheek to his.\n“Very good. See? If you had behaved this way from the beginning, everything would've been simpler. If you start making me feel happier by showing some aegyo[1] and stuff from now on, I'm gonna treat you right, you know?”\nWhile constantly enjoying the riches of Shin Sang-Ah's body, Kang Seok then pointed his chin outside the barrier.\nThere were only two people remaining there— Seol and the currently-unconscious Yun Seora.\n“So, how does it feel to be betrayed? Why don't you enlighten us, Mister Gold Mark?”\n\n[Kang Seok's Status Window]\n[1.

Physical Level]\nStrength: Low (Intermediate)\nEndurance: Intermediate (Low)\nAgility: Low (High)\nStamina: Low (High)\nMana: Low (High)\nLuck: Intermediate (Low)\nRemaining ability points: 0\n\nSeol was busy looking at Kang Seok's Status Window. He felt like he could understand just a little where it all went south for this idiot. Besides that 'gift of gab', he seemed to be suffering from a few noticeably negative traits.\n“Hey, friend.”\nSeol's brows furrowed slightly at that. ‘A friend, huh.’\n“I feel really sorry for you.”\nKang Seok seemed to be genuinely sorry for Seol, judging from his facial expression.\n“Why do you insist on living like that? Mm?”\nHe lightly tapped on Shin Sang-Ah's head and continued on.\n“You don't seem to have any morals.”\n“Morals?”\nKang Seok began chortling as if he had heard something funny.\n“Aigoo~ my friend…. Ah, I get it, I get it. Really! There is a reason to be mindful when we're on Earth. There are laws and stuff, and if I don't follow them, I will end up behind bars. However….”\nKang Seok pointed at the ground below.\n“However, this isn't Earth. Meaning, there's no reason for me to stay the same here. You too are an Invited, so you should know this by now, no? We're going to a brand new world? My ass! In the end, this is all just a fucking game, man! A game. And you're supposed to enjoy playing games.”\n“A game, huh.”\n“Yup. So, what's the point of keeping up with your morals here? Like, what's the fucking point of being the best, kindest, and the fairest in this place? There is no one here who gives a shit about those things. Only 'I' counts. I'm telling you, nobody cares.”\n“Ahh, aheuck!”\nKang Seok suddenly grabbed Shin Sang-Ah's hair and yanked, causing her to gasp out in pain.\n“Look at her. She's your proof. She only latched onto you for a bit so that she can leech off of you. I mean, you saw it with your own two eyes, right? How did she react when the situation changed just now?”\nShin Sang-Ah slowly averted her gaze.\n“So, the point here is that, don't suffer losses. You have that much talent, and I can tell you got a quick brain in that head of yours too. So why couldn't you just close your eyes and commit to the program?”\nSeol continued to listen while standing there, his arms across his chest.\n“You want to look after these weaklings? What a load of fucking bull crap. You think all those with power are evil, and weaklings are all pure, nice folks? You still think these losers are nice?”\nKang Seok passionately spat out his words.\n“I can see that you've received some mental damage just now. But, you know what, don't be too discouraged, man. That's how~ the world operates. You're supposed to exceed the 'haves', and step on the 'have-nots'— that's the only way you can survive. You stay mindful of this guy and that girl, then sooner or later, you'll be bitten by all sorts of stray mutts. Only you'd end up dead.”\nSeol slowly closed his eyes. The words coming out of Kang Seok was something he too was thinking about recently.\n“You still don't get it? What happened to Yi Seol-Ah earlier? And what's happening to you now?”\n“….”\n“You see, it's not that the 'one who's supposed to make it' are making it, but those who are willing to make it, are making it. Also, it's not that those supposed to fail are failing, it's just that they are destined to never make it. Simple.”\n“…Those who are destined to make it….”\n“That's right!”\nKang Seok shouted out of the blue and extended his hand.\n“Now that I've talked this much, I'm sure you get it now. So.”\n“?”\n“Like true men, why don’t we let bygones be bygones? As a symbol of starting over…. Ahh!”\nAs if he remembered something, Kang Seok withdrew his hand.\n“I still should make you apologize, though.”\nSeol's eyes narrowed.\n“An apology, huh.”\n“That's right, an apology. The spot you sucker punched me still hurts, you know?”\nWhew—\nKang Seok spat out a sigh and loosened his shoulders.\n“If you've really changed the way you think, I'm sure it's not that difficult for you to do something as small as making an apology, right?”\nSeol quietly stared at Kang Seok.\n“Well, it's a simple matter, anyway. All you have to say is one word— sorry. Then, we can become true friends afterward.”\nSeol took a glance at Yun Seora.\n“Not her. You gotta leave her there.”\nKang Seok must've noticed Seol's gaze because he spoke in no uncertain terms.\n“I'll have to refuse your apology if it comes from a mindset where you're thinking that you can't help it if it means saving Yun Seora. You see, I really hate hypocrites.”\nSeol shifted his gaze away and then placed his left hand on the invisible barrier.\n“…So…”\nKang Seok smirked; his mouth opened up progressively wider in a smile as if his long-held wish was finally getting granted.\n“…So…”\nSeol sounded as if he was desperately squeezing out his voice 'unwillingly'. Like a kid opening up his birthday present, the colors of Kang Seok's expression brightened even more.\nSeol held his breath, then clenched his fist.\n“….Son of a bitch.”\n“I was lyin…. Huh!?”\nJust as Kang Seok forgot what he was going to say and sat there stupefied, the safe area behind him became quite noisy.\n“What the hell?”\nJeong Minwoo turned around to find out why it became so noisy over there.\nAnd just as Seol was about to produce a spell ball from his pocket… \n\n1.

    "content": "SLAM!!\n“Keuk!”\nBlood spilled on the ground. Jeong Minwoo's large frame tilted unsteadily to the side before falling down hard with a loud thud. Then, from the seemingly empty space, Hyun Sangmin's figure slowly revealed itself like a ghost. There was a steel bar clutched in both of his hands.\n“What the…!?”\nThe utterly stunned Kang Seok tried to stand up from the chair, but he couldn't. Shin Sang-Ah was desperately clinging on to Kang Seok's waist with both of her hands tightly interlocked as if the ghost of Nongae[1] had come to possess her. She was also pushing down on him with all of her body weight.\n“Sungjin!!”\nShe shouted out while lowering her head in a hurry.\n“Uh? Oh! Right!”\nKang Seok had no choice but to watch on helplessly as a chair descended upon his unguarded face. Accompanied by a dull impact and a thud, his head snapped to the left.\n“Kuaaaak….”\nKang Seok then slowly fell to the floor, his face dazed and frozen as a whimper leaked out of his mouth.\n“….Who the hell do you think you are to say my sister's name?”\nYi Sungjin angrily spat out while carrying the chair.\nNow left alone, Yi Hyungsik dazedly stared at Hyun Sangmin as the latter man spat on the floor in disgust.\n“Take a nap.”\nOne swing of the steel bar later, Yi Hyungsik's upper torso spun as if he was performing a traditional dance, then he crumpled to the ground.\nSeol could only stand there and stare at the three of them, still frozen in the middle of trying to throw a spell ball. As he continued to blink in a stupefied state, he ended up witnessing something… interesting.\nKang Seok was pulling out his other paper talisman even as his eyes were swimming from the impact to his head. He almost went unnoticed, but at that moment Shin Sang-Ah, baring her teeth like an angry lioness, pounced on him.\n“Aaaaaak”\nHer teeth tore into his flesh; Kang Seok threw his head wildly while screaming in pain. She didn't stop there though but proceeded to climb up on top of his writhing body and lifted her hands up high.\n“In all my life, I…. I…!”\nSlap!\nHer wide-open palm powerfully slapped Kang Seok's face.\n“I've never, ever seen….!”\nSLAP!!\n“….A damn perv like you who's so fixated on a girl's naked body, you damn son of a bitch!!”\nSlam!\nHer third hit was an elbow drop roughly aimed at Kang Seok's nose. Blood exploded out from his nose.\nKang Seok was laid out on the floor like a dead frog, and when her elbow hit its mark, he began convulsing like a person having a seizure. But that must have not been enough to cool her anger, as Shin Sang-Ah stood up while breathing like an angry bull before lifting her foot up as high as she could.\n“….She, she wouldn't….”\nSeeing this, Hyun Sangmin flinched and stopped his actions of making sure that Yi Hyungsik and Jeong Minwoo would not get up again with the help from the steel bar meeting their faces. And he squeezed his eyes shut when her heel accurately slammed down on Kang Seok's family jewels.\n“@%#%^%!!!!!!!”\nPerhaps Kang Seok had some energy left over as his scream was loud enough to tear open his own vocal cords.\nOnly then could Seol feel the restriction spell being deactivated. Since the owner of the spell lost consciousness, it was only natural that it would be canceled out.\nSeol was able to regain his focus when he heard the wet, sticky footsteps coming from his rear.\nIt was the monster, Gaekgwi. It would've been strange if the creature didn't show up after such noisy chaos unfolded. Although Seol was confident in being able to kill the monster, he'd rather make sure that an unlucky accident wouldn't happen.\nSeol hurriedly carried Yun Seora into the safe zone and then pulled the still-enthusiastic Shin Sang-Ah inside as well.\n“Miss Shin Sang-Ah!! Miss Shin! Please, stop!”\n“Let me go! Let me go, right now! Do you have any idea how much this bastard…!! I, I….!!”\n“It's the monster! The Gaekgwi has shown up!”\n“….Eh? ….!?!? Mommy!!”\nWhen Shin Sang-Ah confirmed the monster's terrifying outer appearance approaching them, her attitude did a 180 real fast and she jumped into Seol's arms. Somehow successfully calming her down, Seol carried her back into the safe zone, and only then could the four of them breathe long sighs of relief.\nIt felt like they had to go through a torrential storm, all thanks to a certain someone.\n“Whew. First time ever hitting another person like that.”\nHyun Sangmin's hand, as it pulled out a cigarette, was unsteady. He offered what he extracted out from the packet first to Seol.\nSeol was about to pull out his own but quietly accepted that instead.\n“Hey, man! What are we going to do about those three outside the classroom?”\n“... Should we bring them inside then?”\n“You do that, and we are through.”\nHyun Sangmin bitterly spat out his opinion.\nNot too long after, the two men looked at the corridor through the classroom window. The Gaekgwi had come closer before anybody had noticed, and was in the middle of slowly devouring Jeong Minwoo.\nCrunch, crunch.\nSeeing the monster chew and swallow the man headfirst, Seol could only feel the sense of astonished disgust.\n“What happened just now?”\n“Mm? Oh, that! Yeah, well, that boy and I exchanged a look, if you know what I mean. I was the one who signaled Miss Shin over here, though.”\n‘Did that really happen?’ Seol felt rather dazed after hearing that since he genuinely had not noticed it. Hyun Sangmin chuckled, sounding rather pleased with himself.\n“What? You thought we really betrayed you just now?”\n“How did you signal each other?”\n“Like this. I just had to show this off a bit, and….”\nHyun Sangmin began fiddling around with a half-torn piece of paper but, ‘it’ happened right then.\n“K-kuuuuak!!”\nSuddenly, the sliding door was flung open and Kang Seok's face entered the classroom. His arm was clawing the floor, desperately trying to reel himself inside.\nThe two men couldn't hide their surprise. To think that he was able to regain his consciousness so quickly after being pummeled like that. His endurance was indeed higher than average according to his Status Window, so that might have been enough to explain his resilience.\n“Where the hell do you think you're trying to enter!?”\nAs soon as she saw him, Shin Sang-Ah ran hard and kicked Kang Seok's head like a ball.\n“K-kuk!! P-please! H-help me!”\n“Help you!? You bastard! Have you forgotten all the crap you did already!?”\n“…P-please!”\n“Get lost! Get lost!!!”\nShe stomped down on his hand that was desperately clinging onto the floor. In the end, he couldn't continue holding on, and his body was sucked out of the doorway like a receding tidal wave.\nMeanwhile, the Gaekgwi had finished devouring the two lackeys, and when it saw the bloodied Kang Seok, it reached out and grabbed him as if he was a delicious dessert.\n“Hey! You, you devour that asshole slowly, okay!? You eat him piece by piece, got that!?”\nThe Gaekgwi blinked its large eye several times while hearing that. Then it proceeded to chew on Kang Seok from his feet onwards. Hyun Sangmin began shuddering after witnessing all this.\n“I, uh, I didn't know she was this insane.”\nSeol almost ended up agreeing out aloud with him there.\n“And well, there we go, that thing finishing everything up. Though, I hadn't gotten my share of satisfaction yet.”\n“Isn't it enough just watching them die like that?”\n“Well, I guess so… But still, how are we going to deal with that thing now?”\nHyun Sangmin sighed and covered his face.\nThey might have taken care of Kang Seok and his lackeys, but a new problem rose up to replace them: the monster Gaekgwi. If that thing decided to camp out in front of the safe zone's door, then they had no answers to that at all. And it was obvious that they couldn't just stay in the safe zone for thousands or ten thousand years either.\n“In that case, we better kill it then.”\n“Eh?”\nSeol's voice was refreshingly confident.\nKang Seok's screams that grew louder and louder eventually stopped at a certain point. When Seol opened the window and took a look, he could see a dead body that was missing the entire lower section from below the chest.\nSeol then lightly tapped on the window sills. The Gaekgwi spun its head around like a bolt of lightning, faced him, and opened its jaw wide while emitting a chilling, shrill cry.\nSeol found the sight of the chewed-up human flesh stuck in between the monster's teeth rather disgusting and unappealing, so he quickly chucked in a spell ball down its basketball-hoop sized throat.\nThe desired result occurred right away; the Gaekgwi began showing an unusual reaction after swallowing the spell ball. It began falling down on the ground while all of its limbs began convulsing uncontrollably. Its large eye shook so hard that the hidden whites could be seen; out of his wide-open mouth, the monster belched out a thick, dark fog.\n'I guess one ball wasn't enough.'\n“What did you throw in there?”\n“It's a spell ball called 'Poison Fog'.”\nSeol answered rather briefly and pulled a couple more spell balls out from his pocket, before asking Hyun Sangmin a question of his own.\n“Right. What was that thing earlier?”\n“What thing?”\n“You suddenly appearing out of thin air like that.”\nWhile speaking, Seol carefully took aim and threw another spell ball. The red-colored spell ball drew a small arc in the air and landed perfectly inside the Gaekgwi’s mouth once more.\n“Oh, that? I also got a paper talisman through my Random Box, you see. For concealment.”\n“Concealment, is it?”\nHyun Sangmin nodded his head while paying very close attention to the suffering Gaekgwi.\n“I can stay invisible for a long time, but it gets canceled if I attack someone even just once.”\n“Didn't you say you only received 500 Survival points?”\n“What the!? Hey, man, let that one go, will ya? In any case, I helped out, didn't I? And, I need to hold a hidden trump ca….”\nBoom!!\nHyun Sangmin couldn't finish his sentence thanks to the sudden explosion. Hyun Sangmin mouthed, ‘What the hell was that?’ and quickly took a look outside the window, only to yank the sunglasses off his face.\nKkkkiiiieeeecccckkk!!\nThe Gaekgwi was rolling on the ground, evidently in a lot of pain. And whenever there were sounds of explosion coming from its innards, its entire body took on a reddish hue and began swelling up.\n“You, you even had something like that!?”\n“Well, I was going to use it just now, but you guys made a move first, so…. Oh, it's running away.”\nThe Gaekgwi was doing whatever it could to scramble away, but Seol simply chucked another spell ball, which accurately landed on the fleeing monster's back. Next, an explosion of light occurred, and dozens of spiderweb-like things shot out, tightly binding the Gaekgwi to the spot.\n“….”\nIt was about here that Hyun Sangmin decided to shut up and simply watch the proceedings unfold. All the enthusiasm he felt had been drained out of his system by now, and not only that, he was too worn out to feel shocked anymore.\n'This should finish it off.'\nThe last spell ball landing on the monster transformed into a clear liquid and rained down on the monster that couldn't go anywhere.\n“What happened!?”\nShin Sang-Ah asked after belatedly approaching them.\n“I killed it.”\nSeol spoke while pointing at the corridor.\nAs it turned out, the most powerful spell ball of the four was the ‘Hydrochloric Acid’ one. It even melted that scary monster into nothingness in the blink of an eye.\nWithin the corridor, a mass of rotting flesh that was once the Gaekgwi could be found lying on the floor.\n“Oh, wow…. Really….”\nSeol explained himself further as the others showed disbelieving reactions.\n“The Guide was right. By drawing a couple of spell balls each, we could've gotten to have fun with this mission. And well, I got lucky with the right combination of spells.”\n“Spell balls? Combination?”\n“Yes. I spread the 'Poison Fog' inside its body, which served to strengthen the explosions caused by the spell 'Ignite'. I tied down the escaping Gaekgwi with the spell 'Spider Web', and then showered it with ‘Hydrochloric Acid’.”\n“Oh, my….”\nShin Sang-Ah's mouth opened wide, and she quickly brought up her hand to cover it.\n“….Isn't that a bit…. too cruel….”\nSeol and Hyun Sangmin could only stare at her totally dumbfounded— even Yi Sungjin too, as he sat there with his back against the wall.\n*\nDawn was mercifully uneventful.\nInside the safe zone where only eight people now remained, two men were busy chatting to each other in a relaxed manner.\nAfter that chaos had died down, Shin Sang-Ah regained her bearings and quickly treated Yun Seora's injuries. Thankfully, her life was spared, but Shin Sang-Ah had no confidence about the arm and said that there was nothing she could do anymore. Besides, the treatment itself had been delayed, which didn't help.\nThe four of them discussed, and they decided to stay put until midday. They were thinking about waiting for Yun Seora to regain her consciousness, but also, the main issue was with them all being just too damn fatigued to carry on any further.\nWhile looking on at the trio of Yi Sungjin, Yun Seora, and Shin Sang-Ah softly snoring away, Seol quietly asked a question.\n“I don't see that middle-aged man.”\n“Mm? Who?”\n“You know, that guy with glasses.”\n“Oh, the guy who gave up on his fami…. Cough. Why? You wanna go out and look for him, too?”\nSeol didn't reply, and simply chugged down a bottle of energy drink.\nA short period of awkward silence flowed between them before Hyun Sangmin tapped a cigarette loose from the packet.\n“Hey, man…. Can I ask you about something?”\n“Mm?”\n“Back then, when you were staring down at Kang Seok…. You were going to use those spell balls, weren't you?”\nFor the first time in a long while, a thin smile formed on Seol's formerly composed, serene face.\n“You were planning to use one, but didn't, right?”\nWhen Hyun Sangmin asked again to make sure, Seol simply nodded his head.\n“Why did you do that? Well, the result was good, so there's that, but still.”\n“You said it before. Human beings would only reveal their true colors when pushed to a corner…. I just wanted to confirm with my own eyes.”\nThis time, it was Hyun Sangmin’s turn to become speechless.\nAnother bout of silence descended upon them. But, a short while later….\n“Fuck, so did we pass or what?”\nThe two men laughed at the same time.\n\n1. A historical figure from Korean-Japanese war.

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 18. Rewards Befitting One’s Achievements (1)",
    "content": "The morning sun rose up but classroom 3-1 remained still and quiet.\nThe very first thing Seol did after waking up was to confirm that his Nine Eyes was still there; his vision became dyed in green before returning back to normal.\nSeol felt relieved after his ability activated without an issue. Then, he came to realize that there were three people missing from the classroom. The bespectacled middle-aged man hadn't been seen since last night, but now, both Yun Seora and Yi Sungjin were gone as well.\n'Where are they?'\nThe time was 09:47 AM. There was still over two hours left until midday, so the Hour of the Deceased should still be active right now.\n'I'm sure they are fine.'\nSeol picked up his bag and the steel bar. Maybe because he and Hyun Sangmin ate a lot of food during the early morning hours, his innards were screaming out in bitter protest. Thankfully, toilets were located right near the stairwells of each floor, meaning the distance was rather mercifully short.\nAfter Seol took care of nature’s call and exited from the bathroom, he spotted Yi Sungjin walking down the stairs, looking visibly downtrodden. After spotting Seol himself, the boy hurriedly bowed his head.\n“Good morning, Hyung.”\n“Yes, good morning to you, too. Did you sleep well?”\nYi Sungjin's smile seemed a bit awkward and weak as if he found Seol's politeness strange.\n“It's alright if you drop the honorifics, you know….”\n“Oh? That okay with you?”\nSeol stopped using honorifics right away; he also noticed the boy's anxious demeanor as well. It was as if Yi Sungjin wanted to hurry up and get going.\n“Still in the middle of the treasure hunt?”\n“….Yes.”\n“How many did you find so far?”\n“Uhm…. If I count the ones I found after waking up this morning, then it's enough to pay for my passage.”\nConsidering the fact that Seol and Yun Seora had monopolized the majority of the coins, this amount was nothing to scoff at. Seol could imagine just how hard the boy must've worked to find that many.\nSeol carefully appraised the round, innocent-eyed teenager's face for a bit. Because of his slightly below average height and the baby fat still visible here and there, if he claimed to be a middle school freshman, anybody would be inclined to believe the boy. In hindsight, him hitting Kang Seok with a chair was a rather wonderfully mystifying act.\n“Thanks for your help last night. I made it because of you.”\n“Ah, that's not true. That hyung did most of the work, anyway.”\nAlthough the boy said so, both Yi Sungjin and Shin Sang-Ah combined their strength to knock Kang Seok out. The boy might not have come up with the plan, but his role in it was still considerable.\n“In any case, I didn't expect you to lend help.”\n“Of course I'd help. I too had to suffer because of him on the second floor.”\n“Oh? You did it out of revenge, then?”\n“No, rather than revenge…. I mean, he was deliberately indulging in only evil things. He had a really twisted, evil mind, you know?”\nSeol chuckled slightly after hearing the teen's declaration. Indeed, Kang Seok was an evil man. As if he had more things to say, Yi Sungjin hesitated and mumbled softly.\n“Besides…. I got a feeling that you would have resolved the matters by yourself, anyways….”\n“Mm? Why do you think that?”\n“I mean, you did kill that Gaekgwi monster so easily. And, also….”\nHe hesitated again, before continuing on.\n“I kinda thought that noona was telling me to find you.”\n“Miss Yi Seol-Ah said that?”\n“Yes…. No, I mean, it's just my gut feeling. I'll ask her after I revive her.”\nJust the mere thought of his older sister must have made him happier because there was a radiant smile forming on Yi Sungjin's face. It was pleasing to see that the boy hadn't lost hope, so a warm smile also spread on Seol's face as well.\n“Yeah, I'm also getting curious, too.”\nSeol walked up the staircase. The boy's eyes dazedly chased after him going up. When Seol beckoned him to follow, Yi Sungjin hurriedly moved his legs.\n“I, I think there aren’t any more coins left on the fifth floor. And you don't have to….”\n“Nope. There are no coins left on the fourth floor for sure. But there should be four more left on the fifth.”\nSeol knew this because he had checked the Diary of the Unknown Student already.\n“Eh?”\n“Besides all that – how did you and your sister receive your Invitations?”\nSeol quickly changed the topic. Although Yi Sungjin tilted his head while looking unconvinced, he still honestly retold his tale in full detail.\nFrom the beginning when his mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and how the family had to go through a tough struggle for a while; how he had heard of a certain medicine that could cure the said disease existing in the 'Paradise' from the mouth of a person the family knew; finally, to how he and his sister got to receive their Invitations. When Seol asked about the matter of his schooling, Yi Sungjin mumbled some things and hurriedly glossed over it.\nSeol found the remaining coins while listening to the story, and the two of them headed off to the library next.\nThe coins remaining in his possession was 885 – from the original amount of 1065, he gave 30 to Shin Sang-Ah, and he spent further 150 on trying to get the right medical supplies for Yun Seora. Now that there was no need to spend coins to open the sixth floor, even after deducting his passage fee, he could still freely spend 785 coins.\n“I'll try my best, but I can't give you any guarantees, okay?”\nYi Sungjin looked like he still hadn't understood what was going on.\n“I have nearly 800 coins on me. The 'Revival' should be listed under SPECIAL, so I should be able to spin the machine twice.”\nSeol said as such while pushing open the library's door. Yi Sungjin's eyes grew very large.\n“H, Hyung?!”\nBelatedly regaining his senses, he quickly chased after Seol, but both of their steps came to an abrupt halt right afterwards.\nThere was someone here already. On the floor around the item draw machine, twenty-odd coins were strewn about, and near them, the owner of the coins was squatting on the ground, her hood pulled up to hide her face. Her right arm hung limp.\n“Ah….”\nYi Sungjin gazed on at this sight with pitying eyes, before he proceeded to pick up all the coins on the floor. Seol approached Yun Seora and asked her in a soft voice.\n“Are you feeling okay?”\nHer head buried between her knees trembled slightly. Seol thought she might be raising her head, but it turned out that she was just shaking it, instead.\n“Your right arm…. You can't move it? At all?”\nShe silently nodded her head.\n“Uhm, here….”\nYi Sungjin sheepishly entered into the conversation and cautiously reached out with his hands cupped together. Coins filled his hands.\nFinally, Yun Seora raised her head. She blinked her reddened eyes several times. Tear marks were still visible on her cheeks. Her slowly rising left hand trembled visibly to the naked eye.\nShe received the coins with much difficulty and dropped her head again.\nSeol gently grasped the shoulder of the panicking and flustered boy. He then shook his head quietly, which led the boy to slowly nod his head in understanding.\nSeol then moved on, choosing to insert his coins into the machine in silence, instead. When he inserted the 300th coin, he could clearly hear Yi Sungjin gulping down a huge dollop of saliva. Seol looked down in time to see a familiar-looking item box fall down with a clung!\n[A quill pen of flowing consciousness, x1]\n'A quill pen?! What?'\n….Whatever it was, it definitely wasn't what he wanted. Which meant that he only had one chance left. Getting a bit more tense now, Seol began inserting more coins to the machine.\nThe second SPECIAL he got was a box he hadn't seen before. His heart beat from anticipation as he opened the lid – only to find ten spell balls neatly arranged inside. Just to make sure, he picked each one up and carefully checked them out. Unfortunately, these balls seemingly weren't designed for things like reviving someone from the beginning. He found none that could help.\n“….I'm really sorry.”\n“I, it's fine. I know that you did this only out of your generosity….”\nAlthough he said that, Yi Sungjin was noticeably despairing. The higher one's expectations were, the greater the disappointment one would suffer – the teen was trying his best not to show it, but tears were forming on his eyes.\nBut there was nothing either of them could do. The world didn't operate to their wishes and whims, after all. And all of the coins had been recovered by now, too.\nSeol was wondering how should he go about consoling the boy, but ended up flinching when a finger poked him on the ribs.\n“?! Oh, it was you, Miss Yun Seora.”\nShe suddenly offered her hand.\n“Here….”\nShe didn't speak for long, but it was clearly audible. And on her small left hand, a miniature bottle wrapped up in paper could be found. Seol dazedly stared at both of them.\n“This is the potion of revival.”\nIt was the first time Seol heard her speak a proper sentence. There was a certain coldness to her voice, but it was also rather pleasing to listen to as well, just like a cool wind brushing past one's ears.\n“Are you… giving this to us?”\n“Yes.”\nThis was unexpected. Why was this 'disinterest personified' doing an act of kindness out of the blue?\nAs if she had read Seol's facial expression, Yun Seora tried to clear up her position.\n“I heard from the boy not too long ago. Yesterday….”\nWhen Yun Seora shifted her gaze to Yi Sungjin's direction, the boy got flustered and raised his voice.\n“I, I ran into her earlier during the treasure hunt! She, she asked me what was going on, so, I, uh….”\nWhile he was speaking up, Yi Sungjin's eyes were completely fixated on Yun Seora's offered hand.\n“Is it okay for us to receive this? What about your arm?”\n“This item won't work on a living person. You'll understand once you read the paper.”\n“….”Seol cautiously received the bottle. Her skin that came in contact with his was cold and very smooth.\nYun Seora spat out a long sigh and brushed past the two males to leave the library as if she was finished with her business here.\n“I, uh, thank you so much!”\nYi Sungjin shouted out loudly.\n“Thank you!! Really! Truly! Thank you!”\nTears were already flowing out from the boy's eyes as he bent his back forward 90 degrees.\n“Thank you.”\nSeol too thanked her. She stopped walking, then.\n“….Me, too.”\nShe then bowed slightly as well, before quickly leaving the library for good.\n'I guess she's a nice person, after all….'\nSeol tilted his head slightly, before quickly unwrapping the paper around the bottle. If he delayed any longer, Yi Sungjin might die of anticipation right in front of his eyes.\n[Requirements for usage]1. To be used on the Deceased only!2. A portion of the Deceased's body part.3. The cancellation of the state of insubordination for the Deceased – “death of the Gaekgwi.”\n“The first and the third requirements are met already, but… a portion of the body part?”\n“I know where to find that!”\nYi Sungjin hurriedly pulled Seol along.\nThe place the boy led them to was a laboratory. However, as soon as the boy enthusiastically jumped inside the lab first, Yi Sungjin screamed out in fright. Seol held the steel bar tightly and entered too, only for a shocked gasp to escape from his mouth.\nThe middle-aged man, missing since last night, was lying on the floor – his body torn in half, from top of his head right down to his groin.\n“He, he wasn't here last night, though?!”\nYi Sungjin fell even deeper into frightened confusion. However, Seol could roughly guess what happened here. Just by taking one look at that gruesome sight, it told him all he needed to know.\n'Did they hate him that much….? To kill their husband, a father, like this….'\nIt was in stark contrast to Yi Seol-Ah, who allowed her younger brother to run away.\n“Sssuuunnnggg---Jjjiiinnn….?”\nAn ear-grating voice came from the corner of the lab. Seol and Yi Sungjin spotted a figure squatting down there, just like how Yun Seora did back in the library. Checking the appearance of this figure, Seol's brows instinctively furrowed. It was his first time seeing a Deceased, and sure enough, it was as grotesque as he had imagined.\n“Noona!!”\nYi Sungjin quickly recovered from the shock and jumped up and down.\n“You can live again!! Really!”\n“Llliiivvveee….?”\n“This hyung, this hyung got the potion to revive you!!”\nAt the same time, Seol could feel his hand getting rapidly warmer. The miniature bottle in his hand began emitting bright light.\nHe didn't know what to do next, so he simply removed the cork to see what might happen – then, the clear liquid inside the bottle flowed out by itself and slowly danced in the air.\nThe way it wiggled like that, it seemed to be asking Seol who he wanted to revive. Seol pointed at Yi Seol-Ah. The liquid then smoothly flew over as if it understood his command. It disappeared as soon as coming in contact with the Deceased in the blink of an eye as if it got sucked in.\nPaat!\nA bright light exploded out from Yi Seol-Ah's figure. It was so blinding, Yi Sungjin near her had to squeeze his eyes shut.\nHowever, Seol could still see a blurry but amazing sight unfolding amongst the cascading rays of brilliant light. He saw her wounds slowly disappear, and new flesh grew to replace the missing parts.\nThen, with a sudden flash, the blinding light shower came to an abrupt end. At the spot where the light had died down, a girl was sitting on the floor, her eyes wide open and blinking non-stop. The previously-grotesque appearance was nowhere to be found, only to be replaced by the warmth and prettiness she used to have.\nFinally, Yi Seol-Ah had been revived.\n“N, Noonaaaa!!”\nYi Sungjin ran as if he was flying and embraced his older sister tightly.\nThe two of them must have more tears left to shed – Yi Seol-Ah remained confused for a while, but when she saw Yi Sungjin crying his eyes out, she too began sobbing as well.\nSeol quietly left the laboratory while closing the door behind him. It was a moving reunion, but he didn't belong there.\nHe hesitated slightly, wondering whether he should leave them alone before he leaned against the door and crossed his arms. While listening to the siblings cry their hearts out, he fidgeted around with the steel bar.\nHe was staying, just in case a Deceased overheard their cries and sauntered over here.\n*\nWhen Seol returned with the Yi siblings, chaos unfolded inside the safe zone. Hyun Sangmin was in the middle of chewing a piece of bread, but his jaw dropped so much that the piece actually fell out. Shin Sang-Ah's reaction wasn't all that much different from his.\n“Seriously now. The revival thing was all true.”\nAfter listening to a brief explanation, Hyun Sangmin laughed out loudly.\nSeol handed over a packet of food from the convenience store to Yun Seora as well as to the Yi siblings, who had been expressing their gratitude non-stop since from a while ago. Seol completely ignored their thanks and began roughly chomping on a convenience store riceball, as if he was completely fed up.\nWhen Hyun Sangmin threw him a questioning look, Seol finally relented and opened his mouth.\n“I heard them thanking me a thousand times while coming here. Now I understand why some people develop neurosis.”\n“Stop exaggerating.”\n“No, it's the truth. It started to get annoying around the 300th time they thanked me. I told them it's enough, but they won't listen.”\nEven then, the siblings were expressing their gratitude in a multitude of ways and gestures. Seol ended up facepalming, before pointing towards Yun Seora, who happened to be sitting away from them a light distance away.\n“Miss Yi Seol-Ah?”\n“Yes, yes! Thank you! I am truly grateful! How should I go about repaying your kindness? You revived me and helped me to meet my little brother again, so I'd like to somehow….”\n“Wait, wait. I got you. I hear you, but here's the thing – I didn't find the revival potion, but she did. She gave it to me.”\nYun Seora stopped quietly biting into her sandwich and threw him a look of protest. Seol resolutely ignored her.\n“Is that true?”\n“Yes. If it weren't for Miss Yun Seora drawing the potion, reviving you wouldn't have been possible.”\n“Y, yeah! That's right, noona! That lady gave the revival potion to Hyung!”\n“Lady Yun Seora!”\nYi Seol-Ah finally left Seol's side. He breathed out a sigh of relief and changed his target to Yi Sungjin this time. He pulled out 100 coins and handed it over to the boy.\n“Your noona's passage fee.”\n“…Ahh!”\nYi Sungjin cried out as if he hadn’t thought about that until now.\n“Please, just stop.”\nSeol pleaded.\n“You don’t need to thank me. In fact, don’t even think to say thank you. You even mention 'tha' of 'thanks', I'm not going to give you these coins. Got it?”\n“….”\n“If you're grateful, then you quickly scoot over to Miss Yun Seora and tell her that. Just like your sister.”\nYi Sungjin carefully received the coins with both of his hands. And, like a good boy, he did as he was told and after joining his sister, combined together with her to land as many attacks of gratitude on poor Yun Seora as possible.\nOnly after somehow taking care of the crisis did Seol get to enjoy his meal in peace. Shin Sang-Ah and Hyun Sangmin simply giggled while watching this unfold.\n“I might die of laughter here, you know? Just look at Miss Yun Seora's expressions.”\n“Yeah, that's quite something else, really. By the way, hey man. How many coins do you have on you now? Besides the passage fee, that is.”\nSeol replied '85'; Hyun Sangmin used his eyes to send him a signal, telling him to look to his side.\nA trio of a man and two women couldn't participate in the relaxed mealtime, and they could only look on in daze from the corner of the classroom. Seeing them, Seol quietly asked Hyun Sangmin.\n“Aren't they going to have a meal, too?”\n“Oh, please. Why should I waste my precious food on those guys? Well, if they were my comrades-in-arms, sure, I might have spared some.”\nEven Shin Sang-Ah nodded her head in agreement.\n“And, also…. Not too long ago, they asked me if I could spare them any coins.”\n“Ah, that's right – their passage fees. They are short by how many?”\n“All three of them combined, around twenty, maybe thirty.”\nHyun Sangmin whispered the information, before snorting out in dissatisfaction.\n“What a bunch of shameless fools. Hey man, you aren't thinking of helping them out, right?”\n“Don't help them. Like, never.”\nFor some reason, even Shin Sang-Ah piped in with a small voice.\nAfter the incident on the second floor, her relationship with the trio had been soured somewhat. If they were like Yi Sungjin who at least tried to open the metal barrier, then who knows. However, as it was now, Shin Sang-Ah couldn't forget the looks of 'it'll be fine as long as you're not one of us' they gave her as soon as Kang Seok made his offer back then.\nEven putting aside the fact that they actually didn't do anything at all, she lost what little favorable impression she had, from their selfish desires to survive at someone else's expense.\nSeol didn't reply. Instead, he pulled out the remaining coins and handed them over to Hyun Sangmin.\n“Mm?”\n“You use them. There's still some time left before midday.”\n“You want me to spend them? On the draw machine?”\n“If you're scared of the Deceased, then don't. However, I haven't spotted a lot of them so far.”\nHyun Sangmin's expressions became rather strange just then.\n“What the… I can really spend these?”\n“I'm telling you, yeah. You can.”\nSeol didn't have anything else to draw from the machine, anyways. Also, since he had peeked into Hyun Sangmin's Status Window, Seol figured it would be smarter to look after him every now and then. Not to mention, if it weren't for Hyun Sangmin, Seol might not have been able to kill the Gaekgwi, so this was sort of a reward as well.\n“Seriously? You aren't gonna say anything about how I spend these, right?”\n“Use them or throw them away – do whatever you feel like.”\nSince Seol said as much, there was no reason for Hyun Sangmin to refuse. With the coins in hand, the expression on his face resembled a naughty kid about to pull a prank. He then sneaked a glance to his side and left the classroom, his steps full of swagger.\n“Let me go with you!”\nShin Sang-Ah stopped her meal and chased after him. The trio glared at Seol with resentful eyes and then, also left the classroom, clearly running after Hyun Sangmin and Shin Sang-Ah.\nNow that those three had seen the coins exchanging hands, they no doubt would beg for some of them. Seol sniggered and began enjoying his meal in peace for a bit while spectating on Yun Seora and her troubles.\nHowever, he nearly toppled over from his seat when the Yi siblings abruptly returned to his side instead. Yun Seora was ignoring them outright in the beginning, but in the end, even she couldn't endure and chased them away, while almost blowing up in anger.\nHowever, didn't the old saying go something like 'even if the heavens fell, there would always be a spot for one to stand up?'\n[A message from the Guide has arrived.]\nBefore long, the midday had arrived.\nThe message told them to gather on the sixth floor.\n*\nWhen Seol got to the sixth floor, he ended up feeling rather disappointed. He was wondering what kind of layout he'd get to see, but as it turned out, the sixth floor was just a normal rooftop.\nThere was a round portal glowing in faint red light set up in the middle of the roof. The Guide, Han, and the blonde maid were standing next to the portal and waiting for the arrival of the survivors.\n“Hee-yeah. Yes, yes! You've all finally arrived. I must congratulate you on successfully passing all of your missions.”\nHan gave them a formal greeting. He also looked like a happy man today as well. So much so, he felt like a somewhat different person from the Han of the assembly hall.\n“Very good, very good! Now that everyone has gathered here, allow me to officially announce the completion of Area 1's Tutorial!”\nClap, clap, clap, clap!\nThe blonde maid silently clapped her hands. Of course, no one else followed her example.\nAs the awkward atmosphere descended on the rooftop, Seol was realizing there was a slight inconsistency to the Guide's declaration.\n'Is this everyone?'\nBecause there were only six people on the rooftop. The trio of the man and two women were nowhere to be seen.\n“From the beginning when 38 lives started this journey….”\nWhile Han started gushing on and on about something, Seol approached Hyun Sangmin who was whistling out in a carefree manner and asked softly.\n“What happened?”\n“Mm? Oh, you mean, with the coins?”\n“Those three people. Did you kill them?”\n“What? No! ….I gave 55 coins to Shin Sang-Ah. I told her to draw whatever. And whatever she got, we split down the middle.”\n“And the rest?”\n“….I'm sure you all wish to enter the portal right away, but regrettably, you will have to wait a little longer. We need to complete the setting of your dispositions, and also…. Most importantly, we need to distribute the completion bonuses as well.”\nHan was still in the middle of his speech. Hyun Sangmin stared at the Guide who seemed to have finally gotten around to the main topic while whispering in a low voice.\n“So, what do you think I did?”\n“?”\n“If you promise me not to get mad, then I'll tell you.”\n“I promise.”\n“I threw them away. All thirty coins.”\nSeol doubted his own hearing, then.\n“You threw them away?”\n“That's what I said. I chucked them down the toilet bowl and flushed them away.”\nHyun Sangmin lowered his sunglasses. Even his eyes were smiling now, too.\n“Not only that, I did it while they were looking on! Dayum! What a shame. I wish I could've stayed and watched them throw a tantrum.”\nHyun Sangmin continued to giggle away."

    "content": "“Will you please keep it down over there?”\nThe Guide issued a stern warning as soon as things became a bit noisy. Hyun Sangmin didn't say anything else and suppressed his laughter.\n“First of all, let us commence with evaluating your level of cognition.”\nAs soon as those words were spoken out, a message popped up in front of everyone's vision.\n[5. Level of Cognition]\nActions/Emotions/Disposition\n“This is how it should look to you. From the left, Actions, Emotions, and Disposition. Well then, let’s start by assessing your Actions.”\nSuddenly, the left-most column began spinning up and down, just like how it was with a slot machine. Countless words flashed by.\n“The first section reflects how you appear to others through your actions and speeches.”\nAs Han's explanation continued, the speed of the dizzying spin gradually slowed down. 'Righteous', 'Fussy', 'Temperamental', 'Disgusting'… all sorts of descriptors flashed by. Seol’s column went back and forth between 'Moderate', ‘Neutral’, and 'Hypocritical’ before finally stopping on the word 'Moderate'.\n“What?”\nShin Sang-Ah responded to her evaluation as if it was the most absurd thing in the whole world.\n“This can't be right! Is this really correct?!”\n“I assure you, things will only get tougher for you if you are getting shocked already.”\nHan chuckled to himself and clapped his hands. Then, the middle column began spinning this time.\n“The middle column, 'Emotions', reflects your thought process or what you feel from facing certain events or phenomena. Out of the three, you could say it has the most variability.”\nFor Seol, the middle column came to a stop with the word 'Curiosity’. Seol nodded his head in agreement. He then saw Hyun Sangmin giggling to himself and couldn't help but get curious – what did he get as his assessment result?\n“And finally…. The last column, 'Disposition'. This one has been raising a lot of controversy for a long time now.”\nSeol didn't even have the time to check using 'General Observation' before the third and the final column began spinning.\n“The 'Disposition' column indicates your inclination according to your overall personality. There have been numerous cases where this part simply repeats what's been shown on [Temperament] of your Status.”\nSeol's heartbeat sped up. He was judged to be 'weak-willed' and 'short-tempered' before. Since he couldn't really dispute those, he had no choice but to unhappily accept them until now.\n“However, there have been quite a few cases, where the ‘Disposition’ and [Temperament] didn't match.”\nHan's voice became rather serious there.\n“How could such a thing be possible? After many debates and research later…. We focused on the fact that [Temperament] was listed under [Traits], while ‘Disposition’ was listed under the [Level of Cognition]. And so, we arrived at a temporary conclusion.”\nWords such as 'Altruistic', 'Selfish', 'Rational', 'Lethargic', 'Evil', 'Detestable' flashed by in front of Seol's eyes…. Until the spinning speed gradually slowed down.\n“If your Temperament is a personality trait formed by interacting with the world at large, then….”\nSeol's column heavily seesawed in between the words 'Moderate', 'Hot-headed' and 'Narrow-minded'.\n“….Then, your Disposition should indicate your true nature; in other words, the foundation that forms the core of who you are. That's what we decided on.”\nHowever, the column suddenly spun again wildly and landed on 'Chaos' instead.\n“If you find that your Disposition and Temperament don't really match, or you find it disagreeable and that you're unhappy with the assessment, allow me to offer you this advice.”\nHan's voice became as light as air once more.\n“If you wish to change your Disposition, then you'd do well to try changing your Temperament first. You see, I personally hold the view that a good Temperament would naturally lead your Disposition towards the nicer path.”\nIf you wish to change – those words rang inside Seol's heart.\n“On the flip side, your Disposition looks good, but your Temperament happens to be not? I can confidently say this – your Disposition too will slowly deteriorate and end up corrupted, eventually matching your Temperament.”\nThe implication was simple – he was saying that one should try to change one's Temperament before it negatively influenced one's Disposition.\nAnd so, the evaluation came to an end. Seol carefully surmised his own evaluation results.\nModerate (Actions and thoughts are sensible) / Curiosity / Chaotic (Many things are jumbled up and is impossible to unravel)\n[Your Status Window is being updated.]\n'Chaotic….'\nAlthough his head was tilting to a side ever so slightly, he could more or less understand why he ended up with that assessment.\nNo matter what, the contradiction coming from the disposition he used to have up until his early twenties, the disposition he revealed after falling into a gambling addiction and losing his ability, and finally, the disposition he suddenly gained after experiencing that dream, was as chaotic as one could imagine.\n“Of course, that's not an easy thing to accomplish. The ‘Disposition’ has the lowest chance of changing, after all. Meaning, a person doesn't easily change.”\nHan winked a little here. It happened, then.\nKoong, Koong.\nAccompanied by loud thuds indicating that someone was coming up, the sixth-floor door was violently flung open. A clearly-incensed woman and a young man hesitantly following behind her entered the rooftop. They were the trio from before. No, one of them was missing now. The girl who pleaded with Seol to save her older brother was not among them.\n“We've brought along the passage fee.”\nWith an icy voice, the woman threw down the object in her hand. It was a wooden handle of a mop, one that could be found commonly in any janitor's closet. However, from where a mop head should've been, only blood managed to drip down to the floor.\nSeol felt like he could hear the sorrowful wail of a woman coming from down below. However, the young man hurriedly closed the door behind him.\nA strange but conspicuous light flashed by Han's monocle.\n“What's the matter? Are we not allowed up here?”\n“No. I shall acknowledge it.”\nHan simply smiled even when the woman spat out coldly. In the end, the two belated arrivals also had to go through the assessment of their own Level of Cognition.\nAs soon as that was completed, Han ordered everyone to line up in a row in front of the warp gate. The first one on the line was the last woman to arrive. She was glaring at Hyun Sangmin with venomous eyes. A deep grudge could be spied on them as well.\n“Aigoo~, I'm sooo scared.”\nOf course, Hyun Sangmin didn't even bat an eyelid.\nThe woman then cast the coins off in a disgusted manner. However, Han showed off an incredible display of dexterity and caught every single one of them. And while maintaining a nonchalant smile, he pulled out a piece of document to read.\n“Let’s see… Ah, it was simple to calculate the points for Miss Oh Minyoung. You will receive 35 Survival Points.”\n“….Survival Points?”\n“You haven't done anything during the first mission, so out of the possible 100, you get 0. No need to mention the second mission either – 0 out of the possible 150. In the third mission, you couldn't even find enough coins for your passage, so also 0. However…. Just now, you have been judged to have struggled bitterly for your own survival, so 35 points were added to your tally. That is all.”\n“Where are we supposed to use these points, then?”\n“You'll find out once you get there.”\nThe woman, Oh Minyoung, glared at Han for a long, long time. She then wordlessly stepped through the warp gate and disappeared from the view. The next person was the young man who had followed Oh Minyoung up to the roof.\n“You have 0 points.”\nHan's evaluation was short.\n“You've done nothing. Literally, nothing. I can't even see one category where you might have earned a point or two.”\nThe young man was clearly embarrassed as he stepped through the gate.\nAnd so, the entry procedure carried on.\nYun Seora received 317 points. Shin Sang-Ah, 116. Hyun Sangmin, 302. Yi Sung-Jin, 114. As for Yi Seol-Ah, she could only receive 46 for the things she had done in the assembly hall. As people stepped through the gate and disappeared one by one, Seol's turn eventually arrived. Han began groaning out as soon as seeing Seol's face.\n“Really now…. I thought I was going to die while trying to calculate your points. Although it wasn't as difficult during the first mission, the second and third missions were really, really problematic for me. Especially so, during the second mission, when things became really, completely nonsensical.”\n“?”\n“Not only were you not satisfied with breaking the all-time clear record, you then proceeded to destroy all of the traps as well as the mechanisms found there. Such an event is unprecedented.”\nThe tone of his voice was quite combative, but Han was beaming rather brilliantly.\n“In any case, here is your points tally. During the first mission, 200 bonus points added after successfully chasing away the Gaekgwi from the assembly hall. Also, you made a correct move by going upstairs as soon as emptying out the convenience store. Since you were in possession of the diary, all you needed to do was to procure some food. So, 100 bonus points. Another 50 bonus points for rescuing Miss Shin Sang-Ah.”\nThat amounted to 350 points. Hearing this, Seol tilted his head.\n“I thought 100 points was the maximum for the first mission?”\n“That's only for the base points. If you perform certain actions that weren't included within the mission goals, you're eligible to receive bonus points if those actions fall under certain categories. These bonus points can be as much as double the amount of base points.”\nSeol nodded his head in acceptance.\n'Is that why both Yun Seora and Hyun Sangmin have high scores?'\nJust by receiving the points from the first mission, he had become the top scorer.\n“For the second mission, the basic score is 150. 300 bonus points for the fastest clear in history. Another extra 300 points for destroying every trap and mechanism found. Total of 750 points.”\n“….”\n“For the third mission, the base points on offer are 150. 300 bonus points for finding as many coins as you have during the treasure hunt. 300 extra points for killing the Gaekgwi alone. 150 extra points for reviving Miss Yi Seol-Ah. 100 extra points for the act of giving out some of your coins to others, seen as an act of mercy. Total of 1050 points. When calculated together, 2150 points.”\nHan spoke non-stop up to here, but he wasn't finished yet.\n“And finally, possessing the Mark of Survival – which adds a 10 times multiplier. So, your total Survival points tally is 21500.”\nHan folded the paper away and stared at Seol with an envious expression.\n“….You must be very happy. Your points tally is the highest in history. You might even be able to use the VIP store as well.”\n“The VIP store?”\n“There is such a thing. You'll see once you get there…. Oh, I almost forgot.”\nHan suddenly displayed an extremely friendly attitude and leaned in closer to whisper something to Seol's ear. Seol began frowning somewhat after hearing the Guide out.\n“I do have it in my possession. But, why….”\n“I was only reminding you since you seem to have forgotten all about it. After all, you were lucky enough to draw them in the first place. Fufufu.”\nSeol was about to ask something, but then, the blonde maid began pushing him from behind.\n“H, hey! Wait a minute!”\n“My role ends here.”\nThe last thing Seol got to see as he was being pushed into the warp gate was….\n“I wish you best of luck in the Neutral Zone.”\n….Han politely bowing his head, his hand placed on his chest.\n*\nAs soon as Seol entered the warp gate, he arrived inside a small room. Seven people who entered before him were waiting there.\nThe blonde maid was still pushing Seol forward while panting quite heavily. Once they were in, she let out a big sigh of relief and walked past everyone. She opened the exit door and pointed towards the passage beyond it, before walking first in light, airy steps.\nThe passageway was made up of marble. It was long and dark like a tunnel. The group simply followed the maid while remaining completely clueless as to where they were headed off to. But, when they spotted light from a distance, a certain sense of excitement began filling them up.\nThe maid arrived at the exit of the passage first and her steps came to a halt. She then softly opened her mouth.\n—Korea, Area 1, cleared.\nAn unexpectedly clean and beautiful voice came out of her mouth.\n'She could actually speak?'\nAs Seol stood there stewing in mental shock, several other clean and nice voices rang out from somewhere and entered his ears.\n—Europe, Area 2, cleared.—Germany, Area 3, cleared.—North America, Area 4, cleared.—Asia, Area 5, cleared.—Africa, Area 6, failed.—China, Area 7, cleared.—South America, Area 8, failed.—Oceania, Area 9, failed.\n“That's a bit weird, isn't it?”\nHyun Sangmin muttered almost inaudibly.\n“What is?”\n“Six of those areas are the six continents, right? So how come Korea, Germany, and China get a separate area designation? Hey man, what do you think?”\nSeol shook his head.\n“Ah, she's moving again. Are we supposed to enter first?”\nHyun Sangmin's guess proved to be correct. Beyond the exit of the passage was a large and empty area, shaped like a high-end theatre. While walking on the red carpet, Seol took a look around him.\nTowards the darkened front, he could sort of see a stage. Although the lights were off, there were some strange things on the walls that glistened and managed to illuminate the darkness a little bit. The ceiling was so high, he couldn't even see it properly.\nThe maid leading in front took the group towards a row of chairs located just before the stage. The number of chairs was exactly eight. After confirming that everyone had taken a seat, the blonde maid climbed up to the stage and disappeared behind the curtains.\nThat was the signal; Seol could hear many more footsteps coming from behind him.\n“I guess they are from the Area 2. Was it Europe?”\nHyun Sangmin spoke as he turned his head around to look. Over thirty people were following a maid to their seats.\nThe place this maid led them to was a location a bit behind Seol's group. There was a total of 32 chairs. The unfamiliar maid also disappeared behind the curtains as soon as she was done leading them to their seats.\n'So, that many people survived the European Tutorial.'\nAs Seol wordlessly checked them out, one of them also began looking at Seol. It was a woman sitting in the middle of the front row. No, perhaps it would be more correct to call her a girl, instead.\nShe possessed curly light brown hair and a pair of eyes bright enough to softly shimmer within this darkness. The rest of her face revealed with the aid of a white hairband holding her hair back was very memorable as well.\nSeol ended up inadvertently focusing on her neck that reminded him of a beautiful orchid flower until he saw her waving her hand slightly in greeting. So, he inadvertently ended up greeting back with a slight nod as well.\nMeanwhile, people continued to stream inside. Soon enough, Seol got to learn that the number of survivors differed greatly from area to area. Perhaps Hyun Sangmin thought of the same thing as he was constantly muttering to himself.\n“We have eight people. Europe, 32. Germany, 10. North America, 11. Asia, 17….”\nThe queue of people steadily entering this large area briefly broke up. A short while afterwards, five men, all wearing the same type of black suits, appeared from the passage. And there were three people following behind them as well – all women, and for some reason, their heads lowered.\n“Huh. A group of five decked out in identical suits…. Oh, there are three more. So, a total of eight people from China, I guess?”\nThat was the end of the queue and no one else entered afterwards, no matter how long they waited.\n“Does that mean there are no survivors from South America and Oceania?”\n“Don't forget Africa, too. When transitioning from Area 5 to Area 7, there was a short gap there.”\nHyun Sangmin added his opinion while agreeing to Seol's guesses.'So, that means….'\nThe surroundings became quiet. Sitting inside this lengthy silence, Seol inexplicably began recalling Han's words from earlier on.\n“You possess the notes from the Guide with you, yes? How about reading them and see what's written on them? Ah, I suggest that you read them while you're alone, if possible.”\nSeol got that 'note' while drawing medical supplies. There were three of them, even. But, why did the Guide go out of his way to mention them? They weren't even the so-called SPECIALs, either.\nUnable to calm his curiosity, Seol pulled his bag closer to open it. However, just as he was about to reach in….\nThe curtains hiding the stage were silently pulled to the side.\nPaat!!!\nSuddenly, blinding lights bathed the stage.\nNot just Seol, but every survivor from the six continents dazedly stared at the brightly-lit stage."

    "content": "Seol saw the blonde maid who guided him in Area 1. But she wasn’t the only maid. A total of nine maids all wearing the same outfit stood there, their hands neatly folded and resting in front of their stomachs.\nA lone woman sat in the middle of them all. This woman wasn't wearing a French maid outfit like the rest, which naturally drew everyone's attention towards her. It was unknown whether the lighting was to blame, but her silky hair reaching the arms of her chair had a bit of a sanguine hue.\nA thick coat hung loosely from her shoulders; her eyes were closed and her arms crossed in front of her chest as if she was in a state of deep contemplation.\nA short while later, all nine maids began clapping their hands in unison.\n—Congratulations~ and celebrations~.\n—When I tell everyone that you're in love with me~.\n…They even started singing Cliff Richard’s famous song.\n“What are they doing now?”\nSomeone from the back asked, sounding somewhat flabbergasted. Other people's reactions weren't all that different, either. They were all dumbfounded at this unexpected 'celebration' featuring a singing routine.\nEventually, the song came to an end. The eyes of the woman sitting in the middle half-opened. She slightly jutted her chin out, and as if she was appraising high-end luxury goods in a store, her eyes slowly swept across those sitting in the audience seats.\nThe inside of the theatre remained deathly silent. The reactions of those meeting her gaze were similar to one another – either they got nervous and lowered their heads, or sneakily averted their gazes. The sounds of saliva being swallowed could be heard here and there as well.\nHer heated gaze that reminded one of a predator surveying its potential prey, caused subtle fear to rise up in the hearts of those meeting it.\nHer crossed legs slowly unfurled. And when she elegantly stood up from her chair and walked leisurely towards the front, Seol got rather surprised by how tall she was – she was tall enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with a tall man.\nThe woman suddenly halted her steps and directed her gaze towards Seol's general direction. Or, to be more specific, towards where the survivors from Area 2 were seated. There, the girl who shared wordless greetings with Seol was raising her hand up in the air.\n“Are you also a Tutorial guide?”\n‘She can still ask a question even under such an atmosphere?’ thought Seol. He couldn't help but be impressed, and at the same time, slightly worried. Even he was feeling a certain unexplainable sense of danger from this woman. If he were to put it in words, she reminded him of a wild, untamed beast.\nThe tall woman didn't reply, simply standing there in utter silence and staring back. While her gaze never wavered, she reached inside the thick coat and fished out a cigarette. The light from flame catching on to the end of her smoke illuminated the darkness just enough for the scar extending from her eye down to her cheek to be highlighted in all of its glory.\nIf the girl was sensible enough to pick up on the awkward atmosphere, she would have lowered her hand already. But maybe she was either exceedingly brave or simply daring as she threw another question out instead.\n“Or…. What should I call you? Who are you?”\nThe tall woman's head tilted slightly towards her back. A maid standing two spots to the left of Seol's blonde maid stepped forward.\n“Area 2, Odelette Delphine.”\nUpon hearing that name, the half-closed eyes of the tall woman opened up fully, and she shifted her gaze back to the girl, Odelette Delphine. Her red lips slowly parted and the thin blue smoke eased out.\n“….Just call me Cinzia.”\nThe girl lowered her hand then.\n“What have they been talking about?”\n“That tall lady said that her name is Cinzia. And the person who asked the question must be named Odelette Delphine from Area 2.”\nShin Sang-Ah grumbled softly in a low voice, and Yi Seol-Ah proceeded to whisper back.\n“Cinzia? Othello Delphine? What kind of names are those?!”\n“I think Cinzia is an Italian name. And, um, it's not Othello, but Odelette….”\nYi Seol-Ah smiled awkwardly and tried to explain. However….\n[The synchronization will now commence.]\nSuddenly, a sharp and grating pain assaulted the brains of everyone sitting in the audience section without warning. Seol was in the midst of concentrating on Yi Seol-Ah's explanations and was caught off-guard. A heavy frown formed on his face as the pain attacked him relentlessly. Whimpers and moans came from pretty much everywhere as people began grasping their own heads.\nThankfully, the assault didn't last for long.\n[The synchronization has been completed.]\nAs soon as that announcement was made, the pain washed away as if it was all a lie. Now suddenly freed from the brain-melting pain, the crowd fell into a state of chaotic confusion.\n“I guess the synchronization was delayed somewhat. Oh well, I'm sure you can all understand me now.”\nThe tall woman who introduced herself as Cinzia was looking on as if she found this whole affair quite entertaining. She spoke so fluently that even native speakers would have been impressed. At a bare minimum, it sounded like Korean to Seol's ears.\nPerhaps finding the stunned silence to her liking, the corners of Cinzia’s mouth rose up.\n“It sure is much more preferable to filter them out at least once, right? If they started yapping on and on like a bunch of goddamn parrots, I'd have been really pissed off by now.”\nHer steps rang around loudly as she started walking again.\n“As a show of respect for you all not raising a fuss regarding the synchronization, let me inform you of something important before we start. I don't like beating around the bush. Also, you should have a general idea what this place is by now. So, I'll get straight to the point.”\nCinzia took a couple more steps forward and spoke up in a low but powerful voice.\n“This place is the sanctuary created through the combined powers of the seven deities, called the Neutral Zone.”\nSeol recalled Han's words after hearing that. The butler did wish for Seol to enjoy the kiss of lady luck in the Neutral Zone, didn't he?\n“And in this place, all of you shall be given the chance to prove that you are capable of surviving in the Paradise. You've all received your Survival Points, right?”\nSeol's points tally was 21500. Han confidently declared that it was the highest in history.\n“Long story short, you must increase your points to over 1000. That is the only way to leave this Neutral Zone. Although we've prepared various methods to increase your points tally, we are not going to mind other ways you cook up yourselves. However, you only have one month to do so.”\nA small commotion began rising up. After all, most of them present here heard that, as soon as they cleared the Tutorial, they would be allowed to enter Paradise. So, this was contrary to what they were promised.\nOf course, there were few here that displayed a relaxed demeanor as well. These were the people who got to hear a more in-depth explanation beforehand, so they knew what was going on already.\n“If you fail to gather the points in a month's time….”\n“What is the meaning of this?”\nThe loud voice of dissent came from Area 4. A man with an imposing physique and a beard stood up from his seat. However, Cinzia only spared him a cursory glance.\n“Hmph…. If you don't want to regurgitate that burrito you shoved down your throat before you got here, you'd better sit your ass back down. I really hate being asked a question in the middle of my sentence.”\nThe bearded man blinked his eyes in surprise for a few seconds before his expression crumpled in anger.\n“The hell did you say? Watch your mouth, you spaghetti bitch!”\nCinzia threw her head back in a loud fit of laughter.\n“Certainly a barbaric Mexican, ain't ya? You from the Sinaloa, right?”\n“How do you know….”\n“It's obvious. Out of those with the authority to recruit, the only one who can mass mobilize the Bronze Marks is found there.”\nCinzia's laughter abruptly came to halt and she beckoned with her index finger. The fourth maid from the left stepped forward and handed over a piece of paper to her.\n“Let's see. I'm getting curious here if your results match that mouth of yours.”\nCinzia took a look at the paper, and a mocking smile formed on her lips.\n“0 points? What? Is this real?”\nThe maid quietly nodded her head.\n“You’re not even a Red Mark. Getting a 0 as a Bronze….”\nCinzia threw away the paper and coldly looked at the burly Mexican.\n“I can't bother to talk to you again. Sit back down, burrito.”\n“You…!”\n“Sit. Otherwise, I’m going to make the ones who invited you regret it.”\nThe abrupt change in the tone of her voice was so eerie and terrifying that it roused goosebumps on all who heard it. The Mexican man shrunk back in an instant and collapsed back down to his seats unsteadily.\n“…I think you're all misunderstanding something here.”\nCinzia continued to smoke without saying anything for while before sweeping her gaze across the audience seats with eyes belonging to a wild beast.\n“The official title of this land is Lost Paradise. Got that?”\nShe emphasized the last part of her words. Specifically, the name.\n“Did you all think that because it's called 'Paradise' that you'd get to ride in roller coasters and have a jolly good time? You all better wake up. If I were to compare this place to Earth, then the land you're about to step into is a battlefield full of gunshots and explosions happening every single day. This is a warzone, where you will be permitted to survive only after your enemies are all dead.”\nShe flicked the butt of the cigarette away and crossed her arms again.\n“Just because you managed to somehow escape from a weakling monster, you think you got the right to bark at me? Don't you get the meaning behind the Tutorial? Don't get cocky. You better not fool yourselves into thinking that things you'll encounter in Lost Paradise are around the same level as what you experienced in the Tutorial.”\nThe reality of the situation must have sunk in as the small commotion died down almost immediately.\n“That's right. If you understood, then keep your mouths shut, you useless bunch of woodpeckers.”\nIt was at this moment that a giggle escaped out from Seol's lips. He was seriously concentrating on Cinzia's words but couldn't help himself when she blared out the woodpecker bit. He realized he made a mistake right away and tried to cover his mouth – but he had already become the center of attention by then.\n“You’re…”\nA strange glimmer flickered in Cinzia's eyes.\n“Oh, I see. Indeed, you may find all of this rather… adorable.”\n“?”\n“But, you should try to understand too. No matter how careful the selection process was, there will always be some dirt that manages to escape the filtering.”\nSeol was expecting to hear an earful, but upon hearing her voice that seemingly asked for his understanding, he could only feel confusion.\n“Well, this place will be the end of that anyways.”\nCinzia shifted her gaze back to Area 4's direction and giggled.\n“You are going to go through a lot of hardship, that's for sure. To get to 1000 points from 0, now that isn’t going to be a walk in the park.”\nHearing this, several people began to flinch noticeably.\n“This is the consequence of your own actions. Who told you to get a free pass through the Tutorial?”\nEven Yi Seol-Ah's complexion wasn't so good. Her points only amounted to 46.\n“Now that we're here, we might as well get the awards ceremony done and dusted too. If there's someone deserving of punishment, then there should be others deserving of rewards….”\nCinzia let off a lengthy groan and reached into her inner coat pocket.\n“From now, if I call out your name, stand up. Area 5, Tong Chai?”\nA thin man wearing a white turban stood up.\n“You already meet the requirements. If you want, you can enter Paradise right away.”\n“I choose to remain.”\n“Then, take this.”\nCinzia threw something at Tong Chai. He easily snatched it off the air and asked her, full of curiosity.\n“What’s this?”\n“What, a member of the assassination squad is asking for info?”\nAn unreadable smile formed on Tong Chai's face as he sat back down.\n“If you're really curious, then ask your maid standing behind me later. Area 2, Salvatore Leorda.”\nThis time, a man with a buzz-cut stood up.\nCinzia didn't bother to say anything and simply threw something at his way. The unexpectedly-youthful man caught it, bowed slightly, and sat back down on his seat.\n“Area 7, Hao Win.”\nOne of the identically-kitted Chinese men, a man with good physique and looking somewhere around in the mid-thirties, stood up.\n“Seeing how you carry yourself, I can easily guess where you're from. So, will you be staying?”\n“That is a foolish question. I will be staying, of course.”\nThe man named Hao Win smiled refreshingly.\n“Okay. And then…. Area 2, Odelette Delphine.”\n“I'm also staying.”\nThe girl answered right away. She quickly caught the thrown item that drew a long arc in the air. She checked it and then, promptly raised her hand up high again.\n“Excuse me for a second!”\n“Mm?”\n“I think you gave me the wrong one because it says No.2 on the plate.”\n“Nope. I know full well that you earned 7500 points.”\nShocked and impressed gasps came from the various parts of the audience. Most of the crowd here stared at the girl with the white hairband with disbelieving eyes.\n“If I deduct the 1000 Survival points you got as your starting bonus, then your original points tally is 6500. And your Silver Mark got you a Mark of Survival with the 5 times multiplier. So, you earned 1300 points during the Tutorial. Am I right?”\n“Y, yes, you are right….”\n“How regretful. That amount would have been enough to get you to the top of the rankings. But this time, it's only enough for the second place.”\nThe girl's jaw dropped. Quite likely, she hadn't thought of the possibility that someone else could've surpassed her in the points tally.\n'Wait a minute? Didn't I also receive some Survival points as the starting bonus?'\nNow that he thought about it, Seol did receive 5000 points in the assembly hall as starting bonus. It seemed that the points he got back then were not subjected to the multiplier effect of the Mark of the Survival. In any case, that meant the actual total of Seol's Survival points was not 21500, but 26500, instead.\n“Area 1…”\n“I'm staying.”\nSeol quickly got up from his seat. The back of his head was getting really itchy right about now.\n“How many points did that guy receive, then?”\n“You shouldn't even ask. Just tallying up the original points alone, it's 2150. It's higher than yours by 850.”\n“W, wow…”\n'Doesn't she know any shame?!'\nSeol inwardly complained while catching the incoming object. It was a key with a golden numeral '1' engraved on the attached plate.\n“You know, I find it really amazing.”\nCinzia unexpectedly displayed a certain amount of admiration.\n“It’s already impressive that your tiny country earned the right to recruit people independently, but now a second Irregular has appeared….”\nThanks to her declaration, the eyes that fell on Odelette was now firmly fixed on Seol. He really wanted to decline all this attention.\nFinally, Cinzia gave out a signal, prompting the maids to hurriedly descend from the stage and move to either side of the audience area.\n“What are you all doing? Stand up!”\nSeol was about halfway down to his chair, but he had to stand back up again.\n“The countdown to the month's deadline has begun already. What, you want me to spoon feed you everything you need before you'll starting moving your asses?”\nHearing this, Seol quickly picked up his bag.\nThe blonde maid was waiting for him in a different doorway than the one he used to enter the theatre. It was as if she was telling him to use this one now.\n*\nEveryone formed the same sort of surprised expressions once they exited from the theatre and took in the sights unfolding before their eyes.\nThe so-called Neutral Zone reminded one of a super-massive department store with its spectacular interior. The ground floor was shaped in a huge circle, and wherever they looked, they could find lounges and shops as well as other facilities. And none here could even start figuring out just how many floors, interconnected with spiraling staircases, there were above their heads.\nThey couldn't exit from the Neutral Zone yet, but it wasn't hard to imagine how this place might've looked from the outside – like the legendary Tower of Babel, a tall and round tower.\nSeol found an empty chair inside one of the ground floor's lounges and settled down to survey the area around him. The most eye-catching object within this 'lobby' was a giant noticeboard set up next to a fountain in the middle of the floor. On this board, there were countless pieces of paper that resembled paper talismans stuck to it. And a healthy crowd of people had gathered in front.\nSeol decided to go and check out that later, once things had calmed down a little bit. So, he sat here and organized his thoughts.\nHe was initially thinking of leaving the Neutral Zone right away. Since he already possessed the qualifications, he believed that there was no real need to waste his time here. However, the other four people who had amassed over 1000 points all chose to remain. They didn't even show a hint of hesitation, either.\nAnd also, didn't that man Hao Win say it out loud, too? He said that was a 'foolish question'.\n'Okay, then. What did I dream about this place….?'\n….He couldn't remember anything about this place at all.\nThere must be a reason why all four of them said they'd rather remain here. In times like this, Seol couldn't help but grow resentful of Kim Hannah.\nSeol remained sitting there while rubbing his face, unsure of what to do next. He felt someone approaching him and raised his head.\n“How do you do?”\nThe woman greeting him with dignified elegance as soon as their eyes met, was decked out in a rather familiar attire. Seeing her neatly tied hair, as well as the pair of spectacles sitting on her nose, Seol easily recognized her – she was the second maid standing to the left on the stage.\n'She's from… Area 2, isn't she?'\n“Hi. Is there anything I can help you with?”\n“I'm called Agnes. If it’s okay with you, I'd like the honor of guiding you around this facility.”\nNow that was a wonderful thing to hear. But it also raised a question in Seol's head.\n“I thought we were supposed to find the necessary info by ourselves?”\n“Indeed that is the case. However, we are tasked with providing basic information. And also, providing more information on our own volition isn't against the rules.”\nSeol figured that this nice treatment had something to do with his Gold Mark. He nodded his head in acceptance. Being guided around, instead of stumbling around by himself, certainly saved him a lot of time.\n“Thank you for your help. I'll be in your care, then.”\n“Ahh, in that case….”\nJust as Agnes's complexions brightened, she began glancing behind Seol with a stiffened face. He looked behind and found the blonde maid from the Tutorial standing there. Not only that, there was a… refreshing smile on her face too. Agnes did her best to reciprocate a smile on her own.\n“M, Maria… Of course, I know that Area 1 isn't my jurisdiction. But the Tutorial has ended already. Isn't it fine to yield this little thing to me this time?”\nThe blonde maid, Maria, continued to smile radiantly. Meanwhile, she began raising her middle finger. Agnes's expression hardened instantly.\n“What's the meaning of that gesture?”\n“Excuse me~.”\n“?”\n“Don't fuck around, please.”\n“….You're still as coarse as ever, I see.”\nAgnes let off a soft but resolute hurumph before silently bowing to Seol and leaving without saying anything else.\n“Still with that disgusting habit of trying to wag your tail everywhere, you Sicilian bitch.”\nSeol couldn't help but doubt his own hearing. He had already confirmed that the blonde maid could speak just fine, but to see such hardcore swearing jumping out of that adorable and radiant face of hers was just….\n“Well, then. Allow me to guide you.”\n“….You are pretty good. With talking, I mean.”\n“Ahh, that. I am currently practicing the vow of silence, you know.”\n“The vow of… silence?”\n“Yes. I'm trying to fix this bad habit of mine. You see, my words tend to not get filtered by my brain and just jump out of my mouth first.”\nMaria was implying that she talked without thinking. Somehow, Seol could see that.\n“Well, uh…. I'll be in your care, then.”\nWhen Seol stood up from his seat, Maria began tugging at the corners of his clothes. Then, she pointed towards the inside of the lounge area. The facilities there resembled a cafe.\n“Before we get started…. Would you like to buy me something to drink from there first?”\n“….”\nSeol turned around to call for Agnes. Maria jumped up and down in alarm.\n“Wait, wait!! Okay, fine. Fine! But, what's wrong with buying me something to drink?!”\n“But, why should I….?”\n“Scrooge. You have a lot of Survival Points, don't you?”\nSeol blinked his eyes a couple of times. While she was begging him to buy her something, she mentioned the Survival Points. Why?\n“Does that mean you have to use Survival Points to use the facilities in this place?”\n“Yes. Within the Neutral Zone, Survival Points act as the sole currency. In order to eat, sleep, and buy things to wear, you need Survival Points for all of those.”\nSeol furrowed his brows. Not just needing to amass lots of points but also needing to spend them – now that would spike the difficulty upwards rather steeply.\n“How do you gather more Survival Points?”\nRather than a verbal answer, Maria pointed at the noticeboard, instead. There was still a healthy crowd of people in front of it.\n“By taking on the missions placed on that noticeboard and clearing them, you'll be eligible to receive points as rewards. That's the normal way of getting the points.”\n“The normal way, huh….”\n“The Survival Points can be loaned out or transferred to others, too.”\nA bitter smile formed on Seol's face. By connecting what Maria said to Cinzia's words of 'we are not going to mind other ways you cook up yourselves', Seol could make a pretty good guess here. Most would go about solving their problems by getting a loan or, more likely, resorting to robbery.\n“Since I told you, you'll buy me something, right?”\n“I refuse.”\n“Ehhh? But, why?”\n“I'll have to conserve my points. It's not like they fall down from the sky or something.”\n“But, why so stingy?! You know you will get free accommodation and food, so how come?”\nSeol tilted his head, wondering what she was on about now.\nMaria sneakily looked around her and began whispering to his ear.\n“Even here, you'll see lots of discrimination, you know. The Contracted has to pay the full amount when using the facilities found here, but that's not the case for the Invited, right? The Bronze Marks get 10% discount, the Silver Marks gets 20% discount, and….”\n“If that's the case….”\n“As a Gold Mark, you get 30% off on every available facility here. On top of that, you were the highest-ranked survivor. So, not only are you given an exclusive residence, but you also receive 70% discount when utilizing the services of certain shops and restaurants.”\nWhen Seol stared at her in disbelief, Maria nodded her head quite animatedly.\nAnd as it turned out, she was telling the truth.\nThe cheapest drink available cost one Survival Point. Maria chose a drink that cost 10 points, but as soon as he showed off his Gold Mark and the plate attached to his key, he didn't even have to pay a single point.\n“You really made a wise decision to stay behind, you know.”\nAs they were headed off to his residence located on the upper floors, Maria suddenly told him thus. Her expression was one full of happiness as she sucked in the drink through the straw.\n“You see, it's really difficult to return to the Neutral Zone once you leave. Since you already have secured your right to leave, you might as well suck out every little benefit you can from here, right?”\n“And what benefits are there that can make my stay worthwhile?”\n“The VIP store.”\nMaria answered him right away and pulled out a pamphlet from seemingly out of nowhere.\n“This here is the list of some of the things you can buy from the VIP store.”\nSeol's eyes grew wider and wider in surprise as he scanned contents of the list."

    "content": "The biggest difference between the area where the Tutorial took place and the Neutral Zone was the facilities available at the latter. If Seol were to get technical about it, then the Neutral Zone could only exist in Paradise and nowhere else.\nHe could definitely agree to the notion of this sanctuary being very special – after all, the seven deities combined their might to create this place.\nSeol sensed that they paid a considerable amount of attention to the safe integration and adaptation of the survivors. Such a thing was easy to figure out when recalling the initial reactions of who all saw this place for the first time. Even he thought he was looking at a high-end department store. The plaza located in the middle of the ground floor or the mock cafes where one could buy something to drink were good examples of that.\nHowever, such considerations could only be extended so far. Just with a casual glance, he spotted several items that people from modern Earth wouldn't have the chance to see or use in their everyday lives.\nBut that was to be expected. Paradise wasn’t as scientifically advanced as Earth, and its culture was different as well.\nIn other words, certain things to remind one about what to come was essential – all in order to minimise the sense of incongruence one might feel during their initial days spent outside the walls of the Neutral Zone.\nThe upper floors were solely reserved for those who managed to amass more than 1000 points during the Tutorial. When looking down from the guardrail of the winding corridor, one could easily take in nearly everything happening below. That proved to be quite a view.\nSeol couldn't hide his anticipation, wondering what it would be like inside the room.\nMaria led him to a door with '1' engraved on it. Seol opened it and entered the room beyond – only to struggle very hard to keep his jaw shut that threatened to drop to the floor.\nThe floor space of the so-called room was as wide open as...\n\nUnlock free chapters every day\nBookmark your novel and never lose track of your progress\nShare your thoughts with your favorite translator in the comments."

Skeletons?'\nThe mission parchment screamed 'danger' even through a cursory glance. The fact that the mission allowed up to six people to form a party told the same story, as well. Quite likely, Seol would find himself surrounded from all sides the moment he ripped the parchment in half.\nHowever, no matter how long he stared, the mission's color remained yellow. And that color, without a doubt, signified that he should pay attention. Seol stood there, hesitating somewhat thanks to the word 'siege', but then he remembered that Kang Seok also glowed in yellowish color as well. If the creatures he'd encounter were on that guy's level, then….\n'I have to take the risk.'\nIf he could survive and succeed, then he could potentially earn up to 15,000 points.

Besides, other survivors showed no sign of even touching this parchment, so it seemed perfect for his current situation.\n'I should still be careful, though.'\nAfter making up his mind, Seol pulled out all the spell balls in his possession.\n'Will poison work against skeletons?'\nSeol deliberated for a while, before deciding to use them even if they proved to be ineffective.

If he combined that with Ignite, then there was a good chance that he'd reap huge benefits – just like the last time.\n'So, it should be better to combine these two….'\nHe carefully checked each of the spell balls and divided them into two groups – ones that would be used in combination and the rest that would be used by themselves....\n\nUnlock free chapters every day\nBookmark your novel and never lose track of your progress\nShare your thoughts with your favorite translator in the comments."

The only way to satisfy his curiosity was to check this Competence with his own two eyes.\nThe VIP store was located on the eighth floor. When he pushed the door open, he found a small room, a counter, and a maid sitting behind it. Her eyes grew wide as soon as she saw him.\n“Eh?”\n“?”\n“Oh, my apologies. I didn't expect to see a survivor to enter through those doors so soon…. Are you perhaps here to window shop?”\n“Is this the VIP store?”\n“If you wish to purchase an item, please enter through here.”\nThe maid pointed towards a small door to her side. It seemed that there was another room behind the one they were in.\n“Unfortunately, it isn't possible to window shop in this store. You also need a minimum of 30,000 SP to enter, as well. If you're curious about the products available in here….”\n“Do you have an item called Competence on sale?”\nSeeing the maid about to pick up a familiar-looking pamphlet, Seol hurriedly interjected. The maid flinched and stopped. She then spotted the piece of paper gripped in his hand and an unreadable light flickered in her eyes.\n“Ah~ of course. The Guide's…. Well, then. The story changes a little bit in that case. Please give me the note.”\nAfter receiving the Guide's note, she opened up the huge closet right behind her. The interior of this wooden closet was packed full with rows upon rows of adult finger-sized potion bottles.\nThe maid pulled one out and placed it on the counter. Seol stared at this small bottle containing a milky white substance. He activated 'Nine Eyes' but couldn't see any color.\n“You will also find Competence in the regular stores down below. However, they pale in comparison to the ones found in this VIP store – the price, the effects, etc.”\n“What differences are there?”\n“Mm….

Just as he had been ordered to, he informed her of his class as soon as it was bestowed to him.\n“I see.” Agnes nodded back while inwardly breathing a wistful sigh.\nIf one were to rate the values of different classes, then the 'Magician' class possessed an unmatched brilliance that no others could hope to match. Not only did this class boast incredible firepower, but it also came with the inherent advantage of cheat-like flexibility, allowing for the rapid adaptation to the situation at hand.\nOn top of that, it was a rare class too. It would be difficult to find even one out of 100 candidates. In order to become a 'Magician', one's Mana stat had to be 'Intermediate (Low)' at a bare minimum. Not to mention, one's personality trait and the talent had to be suitable as well.\nIn reality, the average Mana value of the survivors entering the Neutral Zone was only at 'Low (Low)'. It was only par for the course that their Mana stat would be that low since they had been living on Earth with its advanced technology.\nSo, it was only natural that finding a Magician among them would be difficult. And it was definitely not an exaggeration to say survivors with the Magician class would be treated as a nobility regardless of where they showed up.\nIt was a similar story for Priests as well.

Likewise, the survival rate had improved greatly as well.\nBefore the Awakening, not many dared to attempt 'Normal' difficulty missions. But now, as long as the party's composition was well thought out, such missions could be cleared without taking too much risk. One could even hear rumors floating around that a party had managed to successfully clear a 'Hard' mission.\nThere were three motivating factors that forced the survivors to become more proactive.\nAnd those were 'succeed in more missions’, ‘earn more Survival points’, and then ‘purchase better abilities or equipment'. Everyone could see that they were visibly getting stronger through spending their SP, which led the survivors to be completely immersed in doing the missions.\nOne could say that this was like the famed Möbius strip; Cinzia had hit the bulls-eye on this one.\n“Huaaam~.”\nA man sitting inside the first floor's lounge area opened his mouth wide and yawned loudly.

The longest he took to clear a mission was only around five minutes. Yet, he took several hours this time, so people were thinking that maybe he met an accident and got killed, whether through carelessness or by a mistake.\nBut, here he was, unharmed and healthy as if to taunt everyone looking on.\n“Ha, ahahahaha!!” \nSeol tried to clarify what happened, adding that it was all just a misunderstanding.

So, the three of them chatted for a long time.\nHyun Sangmin's class was 'Archer'. His quick wits and that active personality of his combined to make the decision to not hold back on spending his SP as soon as the Awakening was completed. \nAs a result, he got a head start over his peers in earning more Survival Points, and now he was known as a quite skillful survivor.\nAlthough the team he worked with wasn't as amazing as Odelette Delphine's, Hyun Sangmin said they were steadily clearing missions.\nAs for Shin Sang-Ah, her life turned for the better after the Chamber of Awakening opened up. Her Priest class was a highly sought-after rare class, only losing out to that of the Magician. Thanks to that, the moment her class was revealed, the number of teams that tried to court her couldn't be counted. Some even tempted her with the promise of advance SP payment.\nShin Sang-Ah entered the team that offered her the most amount of signing fee.\nShe was very proud of herself, saying that she was finally living like a normal human being now, only to be promptly shot down by Hyun Sangmin. He mocked her for showing off in front of Seol, who had far more points than she could ever dream of.\nSeol simply smiled while listening to their banter.

However, he just couldn't link the original meaning of the phrase to his ability, 'Nine Eyes'. It didn't feel quite right.\nJust like the 'right' and 'left' directions, there must be some kind of deeper meaning behind the way it was named like that. He thought about it dozens of times, but could only draw a blank. The deeper he thought about it, the more complicated his head became.\nIn the end, he spent the whole night without a wink of sleep.\n'I can't figure it out.'\nSleep didn't want to visit him. Eventually, Seol got exhausted stirring around the bed wide awake and decided to postpone deciphering the 'Golden Commandment' to another time. He knew better than to force himself to a wrong conclusion here. In any case, he needed to find the proverbial loose string to yank out first if he wanted to unravel this mystery.\nThere were two ways he could think of that might resolve this quandary:\nOne, to open up the 'right' direction.\nJust like how the 'left' direction was connected to 'lower' direction, the odds of 'upper' direction having a link with the 'right' was high. If he could find what the remaining three colors were, he might be able to narrow down the meaning of the golden color.\n'But there are no Ambrosias left….'\nTwo, the sole remaining method, was to find the truth by experimentation.\nHaving stared at the ceiling for the entirety of the night, Seol made up his mind and pushed himself off the bed.\nThe longer one stayed in the Neutral Zone, the harder it became to sense the hours passing by. Not only were there no clocks in this place, but most of the facilities also stayed open 24 hours a day, which kind of made finding a spot without light shining on it a rarity. Only the smartphone he received at the beginning of the Tutorial kept him up with the current date...\n\nUnlock free chapters every day\nBookmark your novel and never lose track of your progress\nShare your thoughts with your favorite translator in the comments."

    "content": "Yun Seora. Current age, 20 years old.\nA young woman, who got invited to Paradise after being scouted by Sinyoung.\nThe so-called picky and arrogant woman as coined by the dead Yi Hyungsik.\nAlong with another Invited, Kang Seok, she was seen as Area 1’s top seedling for the March recruitment period.\nShe always displayed the habit of 'think first, act later' in everything she did; her thoughts or decision making were never swayed by emotions, and because of her personality, she held no interest in other people's business.\nSuch characteristics meant she enjoyed a certain amount of advantage during the Tutorial, but once she lost her right arm, her situation drastically changed for the worse.\nShe was very much aware of her weakness in the context of the environments of the Neutral Zone, where cooperating with others was a must.\nSo, for one month straight, she focused solely on fixing her broken right arm. Unfortunately, she had no choice but to revise her strategy and focus on strengthening her fitness level instead after learning that her tally of SP, 317 points, wasn't even remotely enough to heal her wounds.\nAs an Invited, she already had acquired a fairly good understanding of what was going on in the Neutral Zone before coming here. That was why, before her Class awakened, she decided to focus on raising her physical stats. She knew that, as long as she could become a Magician or even a Priest, then her problem would be solved.\nYun Seora did not let go of that sliver of hope, even when stuck in a hopeless situation. However, that got brutally cut off when her Class was set as a Warrior.\nShe left the Chamber of Awakening as if being chased away. And as expected, there was literally not a thing she could do in her current state.\nShe had spent every single SP she had by then. She even had to sell the bag she got as the starting bonus cheaply, too.\nEven if she wanted to earn some points, no one wanted a Warrior with a crippled arm in their team.\nStaying in a proper sleeping quarter became a luxury she could only dream of. She couldn't even afford to eat one meal a day, and her health continued to send out warning signals as a result. Starved of the necessary nutrients, her body got weaker and weaker with every passing day.\nAnd with her weakened body, she couldn't even attempt those Basic missions that did give out a small amount of points as rewards.\nHer determination ran out a long time by then and even enduring through nothing but sheer malice also eventually reached its limit. If it weren't for the Yi siblings that came to see her every other day, Yun Seora would've died of starvation already.\nHowever, she knew that the siblings were also struggling desperately as well.

    "content": "The gist of Odelette Delphine's offer was just as Seol suspected: she wanted him to join her team.\nJudging from her description, he thought that the composition of the team itself seemed to be well thought out.\nHao Win was the Warrior of the group, Leorda and Tong Chai were the Archers, Delphine was the Magician, and the last person Seol wasn't familiar with acted as the Priest.\nConsidering that missions rated 'Hard' and 'Very Hard' had the cap of six participants max, it was as if they had deliberately left the final spot for Seol.\nIf things remained the same as before, Seol wouldn't even hesitate to say yes. Not only did this team feature two people Kim Hannah mentioned he should get friendly with, Seol himself was sensing that the time had come to find reliable comrades as well.\nHowever, the situation was different now. Seol had to amass 82,000 points as quickly as possible.\n'I'd be able to earn that many points even if I join this team, but….' \nObviously, he didn't want to sacrifice himself unconditionally. He wanted to fix Yun Seora's arm, get himself some proper equipment, and also buy more Divine Elixirs from the VIP store.\nIn other words, he wanted to have his cake and eat it. Others might call him a greedy fool, but he did not want to give up on any one of his desires.\nIn the end… he had to decide.\n“I'm truly sorry, but…. At the moment, it's difficult for the time being.”\nThere was a way for him to achieve the things he wanted. If Seol monopolized the remaining 'Hard' missions, he'd be able to earn more than enough points to cover the cost of the Ceremony and still have some change. With that, he'd get equipment and recruit people to form a team. People might slag him off for this, but this was the best scenario Seol could think of.\n“Hng.”\nMaybe she didn't expect him to refuse her, Delphine looked crestfallen.\n“Hmm….”\nHao Win seemed as if he was not ready to accept Seol's answer just yet.\n“I am well aware of how extraordinary you are. I acknowledge your skills, but the difficulty of the 'Very Hard' missions are nothing to laugh about. You alone will not be enough.”\n“Yes, I know.” \n“You say you know, yet…. Ahh, is it because you do not like the composition of this team? Or were you planning to form your own?” \n“I haven't thought of forming a team yet. And, to be frank, I quite like the look of this team as well. I wouldn't mind doing missions with you, actually.”\n“Then why the refusal?” \nHao Win gazed at Seol with a questioning pair of eyes. His expression showed how confused he was, and he continued to study Seol for a bit longer, before tilting his head.\n“Now that I've taken a proper look, I see that you haven't bought any equipment besides your spear. I'd imagine you were able to earn a massive amount of points by now…. Did you invest them all into your abilities?”\n“No.” \nSeol shook his head right away. He never planned to buy abilities from the stores but did want to buy good equipment for himself. The situation got turned on its head before that could happen though.\n“I am even more confused, then. One more thing – if I didn't see incorrectly a moment ago, you were planning to do another Hard mission, were you not?”\nThe question was sharp and on point. Just like his stare was.\n“You have exhausted one mission completely, but as for the others,...\n\nUnlock free chapters every day\nBookmark your novel and never lose track of your progress\nShare your thoughts with your favorite translator in the comments."

The acrid and bitter odor of blood and sweat also faintly brushed by Seol's nose.\nThe two maids that entered before him were supporting the completely exhausted Maria from her sides while leaving the room.\nMaria's previously-radiant blonde hair looked as if someone doused it with a bucket of cold water as drops of liquid fell from the strands. Her thin, white ceremonial robe was completely soaked through as it clung onto her figure and revealed more than a hint of her skin.\n“Ueek…!”\nFrom her cherry-colored shapely lips, a mouthful of blood spewed out. The white robe rapidly got stained in the dark crimson hue.\n“Miss Maria!”\nWhen Seol ran up to her, Maria weakly raised her head up. As if she was already suffering from a high fever, her once-pale cheeks were reddening up.\n“Are you alright?”\n“Fuck…. Can't you see for yourself….?”\n“….”\n“My head's ringing, so please don't shout near me…. I really feel like I might die soon….”\nMaria coughed and vomited out two more mouthfuls of blood. She regulated her breathing and then shot Seol a fierce glare.\n“Don't forget.”\n“….”\n“I did you a big favor with this.”\nSeol wasn't a dummy so he quickly replied.\n“I understand. I'll never forget about today's matter.”\nMaria lowered her head again. She was helped along by other maids and soon, they disappeared beyond the bottom of the stairs and out of sight.\nStill worried, Seol continued to look on before shifting his eyes away after hearing the loud exclamation of joy coming out from his quarters. It was the sound of the Yi siblings crying out.\n“Time for the main character to make his entrance.”\nHao Win lightly patted Seol's back. Although the questions regarding why this guy followed him here remained, Seol was more curious to find out Yun Seora's condition, so he hesitantly took his first step inside.\n'Ho!'\nHao Win followed Seol into the room and ended up gasping out in admiration after seeing the figure of the woman sitting on top of the bed.\nThe way she sat up on the bed while leaning slightly against the wall reminded him of a beautiful snowflower shyly blooming within a hidden crevice in the middle of winter.\nShe continuously raised her right arm and then lowered it. Her actions were somehow like that beautiful flower not knowing what to do when the rays of warm sunlight fell upon it after it was forcibly taken out from its deep hiding place and into the open plain.\n‘Indeed, I see why he fell for her.’ Hao Win silently mused to himself, and then he lightly pushed Seol forward. Thanks to that, the youth ended up stumbling a couple of steps forward, which inevitably drew in the attention of Yun Seora. She flinched slightly and met the youth's gaze.\n“H, how are you feeling?”\n“….”\n“Is your arm okay?”\n“…Ah.”\nHer small but shapely lips parted slightly before closing shut again.\nAll sorts of emotions flashed in her eyes, but her lips could only tremble softly. Judging from her small and nearly indecipherable hand gestures, it seemed as if she desperately wanted to say something, but at the same time, she was at a loss as to how she should proceed.

No, perhaps he should say it was on the right track. \nIn any case, he managed to pay off his debt in just two days. Clearing the 'Ambush' mission once paid out 1,667 SP, so by clearing it ten times, he was able to pay back the 15,000 points and still have lots left over. Even after all that, there were still five 'Very Hard' missions left to go.\nWhat the team tried their hands next was a mission called 'Arrive at the destination within a soundless environment', and it gave out 20,000 points as reward. Clearing it just once netted Seol 3,334 points.\nNow that the debt had been paid off, Seol was able to get lost in the fun of cooperative battles as well as the joy of amassing a lot of Survival Points, without a single worry.\nYun Seora's recovery was just as trouble-free. Like what Maria said earlier, simply by eating well and resting well, and with the added effect of Seol's quarters, her physical fitness level returned to normal in no time at all.\nThe only thing was that Seol couldn't help but notice her being uncomfortable around him.\nOnce, he returned to his room to find it cleaned spotless. The shelves were all neatly arranged, mirrors shone and reflected light brilliantly, and the toilet sparkled blindingly too.\nSeol dazedly looked around, only to spot Yun Seora sweating profusely while mopping the floor on all fours. Of course, he was quite shocked by this sight. Not only could he not figure out why she was cleaning the place, but she was also in the middle of her recovery too.\nHe hurriedly ran up to her and snatched the mop away and asked her what on earth she was doing instead of resting. She only lowered her head in silence as her reply.\nOn another occasion, he returned after clearing a mission only to find Yun Seora missing from his room. And on top of the bed, he spotted four neatly-folded papers.\nThe contents of those letters started off with the expression of her gratitude as well as her apology for causing...\n\nUnlock free chapters every day\nBookmark your novel and never lose track of your progress\nShare your thoughts with your favorite translator in the comments."

By the time he spotted Yun Seora sleeping soundly within his arms, a short cry of fright escaped from his mouth.\n'How can a girl do this when we've done nothing but talk a few times?!' \nHis thoughts bubbled up chaotically, but then he realized that his own arms were hugging her tightly as well. For some reason… he thought her body felt rather comfortably warm.\n“Argh…”\nWhen he tried to forcibly pry her off of him, Yun Seora simply….\n“Mmnn…..”\n….Dug in even deeper into his arms and buried her head in his chest.\n'There, there, little one.

Eh?' \nSeol belatedly realized that he'd been patting her back and hastily removed his hand.\n‘What am I even doing?!’ Seol dazedly looked down at the smiling face of Yun Seora as she rubbed her cheeks against him.\n'….Could this be because of her unruly sleeping habits?'\nEven though he was panicking inwardly, he still managed to lift her up ever so gently and carried her back to the bed. When he placed the duvet on her, he spotted Yi Seol-Ah lying alongside on the bed. The teen girl's limbs were spreadeagled as she enjoyed the sweetness of a deep, deep slumber. Only then did Seol figure out what happened here.\n'Ah. So she was forced off the bed all thanks to Yi Seol-Ah's terrible sleeping habits, huh.'\nYi Seol-Ah must have kicked around a lot since her top was bunched up enough to expose most of her tummy. Seol chuckled softly, lowered her shirt, and covered her with the blanket as well. Seeing her giggle as she continued to slumber away, she must've been having a nice dream.\n'I guess I should sleep a little further away from them tonight.' \nAlthough it was an unintentional mistake, he still did something he shouldn't have. If Yoo Seonhwa found out what happened, just how saddened would she be?\n“…Tsk.”\nAlmost immediately, he realized how wrong he was regarding that matter.

The deadline of the Neutral Zone closing down was fast approaching, that was why.\nSince they needed 1000 Survival Points in order to enter the Paradise, it was not much of a stretch to say that the trio spent almost half of their day near the first-floor noticeboard in order to accumulate the necessary amount.\nOf course, Seol already told them that they shouldn't worry even if they couldn’t amass 1000 points, but the three of them couldn’t feel happy or content about their current circumstances.\nIt wasn't simply because they felt ashamed, though. As time passed, they began to realize the lengths Seol went to support them from behind, and the amount required to do so.\nThe most obvious proof was with them equipped from head to toe with expensive gear. Even though not much time remained until the end of the deadline, only around 30% of the survivors managed to buy a full set of matching armors. Just from this fact alone, the three of them became acutely aware of their advantageous position compared to other people.\nSo, the issue was with them learning how to survive on their own, rather than their pride, instead. Seol had done so much for them already, so if they failed to even earn 1000 points on their own, then they definitely lacked qualifications to be treated as a 'survivor' in this place. At a bare minimum, they wanted to prove that they were eligible to enter Paradise on their own strength.\n'I did it!' \nAfter successfully completing a 'Normal' difficulty mission by herself, Yi Seol-Ah rejoiced wholeheartedly in front of the noticeboard. In reality, her being able to clear such a mission alone wouldn't be seen as too big of an achievement at this point in time by other people.\nHowever, considering how long ago it was when she started doing the missions, the rate of her growth was indeed explosive. On her first mission, she couldn't even pull back the strings of her bow properly out of sheer nervousness.\n'Will he praise me?' \nA smile bloomed on her face as she recalled the face of her orabeo-nim who constantly encouraged her to be more brave, assuring her that she was capable of doing this, and always taking the time to teach her things step by step, even though he should be feeling frustrated by her by now.\n'This is fun.' \nYi Seol-Ah...\n\nUnlock free chapters every day\nBookmark your novel and never lose track of your progress\nShare your thoughts with your favorite translator in the comments."

However, if one were to define it in the simplest terms, then it could be called a 'unique gift'.\nAfter the invaders devoured the Chief Deity, this power was the only method of resistance the humans had against the alien races.\nExcluding one or two extreme cases, all humans generally possessed some amount of mana. An individual’s growth potential was dictated by one's inborn talents or bloodlines, but without a doubt, humans were born with this power existing inside them already.\nPretty much everyone who used this power 'professionally' would say the same thing: it'd be for the best if one started training their mana as early in their lives as possible.\nThis advice wasn't simply meant to imply the fact that one's available amount of mana would increase from the training. One would also get to train the pathways in their bodies where the mana flowed, the so-called 'Circuit'.\nSomeone born with a great deal of this energy needed to pay close attention when they started their training. There had been several cases where the fragile Circuits couldn't endure the circulation of the mana and tore up. In some cases, their Circuits were destroyed completely.\nJust as one would temper the steel repeatedly to remove impurities as much as possible, the 'Circuit' would also strengthen gradually as a manageable amount of mana constantly flowed through the pathway. Thus, training oneself from early on was indeed the right call to make.\nHowever, the situation Seol faced was quite complicated.\nHis powers manifested when he was extremely young. A small pathway gradually formed when he followed his instinct and used his new-found power. Never did he once receive proper training; he didn't even consciously realize that he'd been abusing his power repeatedly.\nAnd the moment he lost his power proved to be a critical point in his life.\nAlthough he'd been using his mana almost subconsciously, he had been relying on it for almost 20 years.

His eyes widened in surprise.\n“Money? But, I haven't….”\n“It's not the contract signing fee. You'll only get that after signing the contract.” \nKim Hannah cut him off before he went any further.\n“Just think of it as a small gift from me saying thanks.

You can spend it in any shape or form you want, but put out the urgent fires first, okay? Not on useless stuff.

This would be his second time entering this world.\nSeol Jihu presented his slip to the counter and received a key in return. He quickly made his way to the storage to retrieve his gear.

He then shouted out.\n“Did you have to use this road through the forest?!”\n“This road is my lifeline! There was no problem nine days ago!” \nMaktan replied without looking back.\n“How long have you been using this road then?”\n“Three months!” \n“Goddamn it!

He knew he had little experience when it came to things like this and left the decision to the two veterans.\nThe duo talked for a while and in the end, the decision was made to go forward.\nThey agreed that rather than going back and waiting for another Archer and wagon, and therefore waste even more time and money, it'd be simpler to just walk the rest of the way to their destination.\nSeol Jihu also agreed. He was slightly worried about walking that much distance, but he decided to trust his overall endurance, something he took great pains to train back in the Neutral Zone.\n“Alright. We leave, but before that, let's take what we can.”\nAfter the agreement was reached, Hugo suddenly spoke up about a different matter.\n“I'm going to look at the Archer woman, so you two go rummage what you can.”\nHugo whistled to himself as he turned around to walk away.\n“I'm going to pick up the daggers the Moles dropped, so Seol, please take care of Maktan's end.”\nAlex, too, quickly made his move.

If they wanted to continue on carriages, then it was indeed possible to do so, but 'going back' would pose a serious problem; without the protection of the expedition team, the carriage drivers would not be able to escape from the danger zones by themselves.\nThe two drivers knew how precious their own lives were, so as soon as they received the balance of payment, they left the area.\n“Today's goal is to get to Napal Hill! As long as we go past that, we will be at the Forest of Denial!” \n….And, along with Samuel's urging, the group began their march towards their destination.\nIn Paradise, a Level 1 Earthling would start as a porter almost always regardless of whether one was a Contracted or an Invited. It wasn’t because they were only good for carrying luggage, but it was actually for them to participate in many different expeditions and adventures in order to learn and experience as much as possible.\nThat was why Seol Jihu paid utmost attention to every little thing occurring around him.\n'The marching formation is arranged like a rhombus.' \nThere was a total of 11 people in the expedition. Excluding Seol Jihu and two other original residents serving as porters, the actual combat force was 8.\nRight at the front of the pack stood Samuel and Grace.
