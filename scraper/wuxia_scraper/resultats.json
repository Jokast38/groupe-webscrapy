    "chapter_title": "Chapter 1 - The Blind Boy, Li Guanqi",
    "content": "Azure Cloud Continent, Northern Frost City.4\nA young boy, only six or seven years of age, was curled up next to a stone lion statue at the back door of the Zhao Estate.0\nEven though it was snowing and the temperature was freezing, the young boy was wearing thin, ill-fitting clothes, and he was shivering.0\nThe strange thing about him was the black cloth strip covering both his eyes. The features not covered by the cloth were a pair of defined brows, a tall nose, and slightly thin lips. His cheeks were sunken because of malnutrition, and his jaw was clearly defined.4\nCreak ~0\nThe mansion's back door opened, and a dull thud quickly followed.0\nSomeone had flung a stiff corpse out the door. The thin body crashed into the snow, forming a shallow pit. Zhao Qing, who was wearing a thick coat, hesitated. There was a flash of unwillingness in his eyes. He tossed four strings of coins[1] on the ground and put the rest in his sleeve.0\nThe young boy rose hurriedly, shook the snow off his clothes, then forced a warm smile.0\n“Brother Qing, did someone toss out some scraps just now?”0\nAs he spoke, the boy squatted down and felt the ground next to his feet with his hand. The smile on his face vanished the moment he felt something—a corpse that had long turned cold!0\nLi Guanqi’s hand froze. He choked and shivered slightly.0\nAfter a brief moment, he knelt on the ground and touched the corpse’s face with trembling hands. It was a young girl.0\nWhen he touched the girl’s jaw, he quickly retracted his hand, as if he had been electrocuted. He had touched a long scar. It was a result of his uncle beating his sister two years ago, after he had gotten drunk and lost money while gambling.2\n“Sister…”0\nA sorrowful moan escaped the boy’s mouth. His smile was long gone. His tears flowed freely, escaping his control. Despite the heavy snowfall, he took the only tattered linen shirt off his back and wrapped it around the girl’s body!0\nHe was as thin as a matchstick and covered in gruesome injuries. The bruises on his back had yet to fade. Reaching out with his chilblain-covered hand, he gently stroked the girl’s hair. 0\nWith his head hung low, he muttered hoarsely, “Death is not so bad. When you’re alive, you just… suffer.”0\nIgnoring the bone-chilling snow, he started to search for the four strings of coins on the ground.0\nHis heart was filled with sorrow.0\nWho would've thought that his sister would be denied proper respect even after death? Receiving the price of someone’s blood was never easy!0\nA chilly breeze blew past them, and Zhao Qing hurriedly tightened the opening of his sleeves. Watching the boy, he could not help but say, “Your sister… was unlucky. Take this money and go.”  0\nThe boy undid the strip of cloth covering his eyes, revealing a pair of pale white eyes. He looked up in the direction of Zhao Qing’s voice, then slowly extended his right hand and said softly, “When a subordinate dies unjustly, the master must pay ten strings of coppers! That money… is the last shred of respect you owe my sister. You can’t take it!”0\nZhao Qing crossed his arms. The moment he heard the boy ask for money, the look of pity on his face disappeared instantly. He said coldly, “You stupid blind kid! Four strings is all you get! Take it or leave it; it’s up to you!0\nSix-year-old Li Guanqi might have been frail, but the expression on his face was fierce! He hurried up the Zhao Estate’s steps, then grabbed the man’s hand and shouted, “Give me what she deserves!”0\nWhen Zhao Qing saw Li Guanqi grab him with his chilblain-ridden hand, he furrowed his brows. There was a cold flash in his eyes, then he grabbed the boy’s hair and flung him down the steps.0\nCrash!0\nThe frail boy slammed hard into the snow. Beneath the snow, the ground was laid with stone tiles; even a gentle fall would result in bruises, let alone being tossed down from upstairs! 0\nZhao Qing took one glance at the boy on the ground, then spat viciously, “You stupid blind kid! Take the corpse and get out of here! If it weren’t for my pity, I wouldn’t even have given you four thousand! Ptui!”0\nJust as Zhao Qing was about to turn and leave, someone grabbed the hem of his clothing.0\nZhao Qing turned and realized the boy had somehow appeared right behind him, clutching his coat in a death grip.0\n“Give me the money! My sister died for that money!”0\nAnger welled up inside Zhao Qing. He was about to strike the boy when he looked down at the pair of white eyes! Although those eyes were blind, he felt as if the boy were staring directly at him.0\nA chill rose from the depths of his heart. He turned to look at the girl who had been worked to death. In the end, he put down his raised fist, took out the remaining coppers from his sleeve, and stuffed them into the boy’s hand.0\n“Take it and piss off! What rotten luck!”0\nLi Guanqi let go and counted the coppers in his hand numbly.0\nThud!0\nThe estate’s door closed. 0\nA young voice called out from inside, “Xiao Qing~[2] What are you doing? Hurry up and feed my birds!”1\n“Right away, Young Master Yuanlin. Right away.”0\n“What were you doing just now?”0\n“…”0\n“Wasn’t that just a servant girl who died? Who freaking cares? Tell that damn cripple to fuck off!”1\nHolding the coppers, Li Guanqi stood on the steps of the Zhao Estate for a long, long time, gazing up at the sky with soulless eyes. He descended the steps, struggled to hoist the stiffened corpse onto his back, then turned to leave.0\nCreak… Creak…0\nThe sound of his feet crushing the snow echoed, one step at a time. Although he was slow, he walked with great determination.0\nAn old man sitting upstairs in a guesthouse only a dozen or so zhang[3] away had observed the whole incident. He was wearing plain, gray robes. Both his beard and hair were white.0\nHe had a tall nose, and although his lips were thin, they did not make him look shrewd. There was not a hint of muddiness in his eyes; they were extremely clear.0\nA few dishes lay on the table, along with a jug of warm wine. As he watched the boy use a wall to guide himself forward, his hand, which was holding a cup, stopped mid-air. There was a nigh-imperceptible twinkle in his eyes when he looked at the young boy. 0\nHe muttered in a low voice, “I can’t believe the disciple I have been searching for centuries is blind…5\n“Whatever. Perhaps this is what the heavens want.”0\nThen, the old man rose slowly and said in a mellow yet clear voice, “Waiter! The bill, please!”2\n***0\nIt was a cold December winter, and the northern winds were bone-piercingly cold. The cold gusts of wind were like sharp knives cutting Li Guanqi. He had to stop and rest several times along his journey, and by the time he placed the stiffened corpse at the door of a clinic, night had already fallen.0\nThe gray-robed elder was now following the boy. Yet, even though his clothing was also thin, he seemed entirely unaffected by the wind and snow, as if they were avoiding him of their own will. 0\nThe boy entered the clinic, only to be met with a raised eyebrow. 0\n“The girl is dead; her soul has already entered the cycle of reincarnation. Why did you come to my clinic?”0\n“I’m here to get medicine for my mother… Not her…”0\nNot long after, the boy reappeared outside the clinic with a few packets of medicine. He once more struggled to pick up the body, then continued his journey.0\nNext, he arrived at a shop with white cloth hanging at the entrance. This time, he took the body with him inside, but when he emerged, he was holding an urn instead. There was a piece of paper stuck on the urn.0\nIt read, Li Cuiwei.0\nHe wrapped the girl’s pink clothes around the urn. Throughout the whole process, his face showed almost no emotion. 0\nAlong the way, he found two stone-hard steamed buns at the entrance of a steamed bun shop. And when he picked them up, a hint of a smile finally appeared on his face.0\nThis baffled the old man following him. The boy had not shown any particular emotions when he found his sister dead, yet he had angrily argued with the Zhao Estate servant who tried to withhold his money. He had not shown any emotion as he held his dead sister’s ashes, yet he smiled when he picked up those discarded steamed buns. 5\nThis piqued the old man’s curiosity, and he continued to follow the boy.0\nSuddenly, the old man stopped in the blizzard and looked up at the sky. He muttered calmly, “Tsk tsk, I only destroyed a sect, yet the Northern Frost Kingdom’s Guardian Priest has personally come to see me?0\n“He’s merely at the Nascent Soul Realm… Well, it’s best that I meet him anyway. It’ll save both of us some trouble.”2\nWhoosh! The old man took one step forward and crossed ten li[4] instantly. 0\nHe appeared in a pavilion in the countryside. An old man in brocade robes had warmed some wine and was brewing tea. It looked like he had been waiting for a long time. 0\nWhen the Guardian Priest of Northern Frost Kingdom saw the old man, he quickly rose and bowed despite his status. He said politely, “Greetings, Elder.”0\n***0\nIn the southern part of Northern Frost City, there was a rundown house whose door could not even close completely. The boy hesitated at the door for a long time. In the end, he took a deep breath and pushed the door to enter the house.0\nCreak~0\nThere was not even a candle lit in the house. The house was almost empty, and even the paper in the windows had many holes they could not afford to patch up.0\nA shadow moved on the cold bed-stove[5]. 0\nThen, a weak voice called out, “Guanqi… You’re home?”0\nThe woman’s voice was very gentle but very weak. This was Li Guanqi’s mother, Song Wanrong.0\nSong Wanrong rose to her feet. Her face was pale and her cheeks were sunken, but she looked at the boy with warmth in her eyes. 0\nSong Wanrong looked around with the help of the moonlight, then she asked softly, “Where’s Cuiwei?”0\nLi Guanqi, who was searching for a candle in a drawer, stiffened. He lit the candle, revealing the lonely clay urn next to him.0\nHe answered bitterly, “Big Sister Cuiwei… died. The Zhao Estate paid ten strings of coppers... I managed to get the money from them. I’ll hide it well and use it to treat your illness.”0\nThen, the boy fished out the buns from his clothes and gave them to Song Wanrong. They had slightly thawed from his body’s warmth.0\nFeeling around, he walked to the kitchen with the herbs and said hoarsely, “I’ll boil the medicine for you, Mother.”0\nSong Wanrong gently pulled Li Guanqi’s hand and placed a bun in it. Holding back tears, she replied, “I’m… I’m not hungry. You eat.” 0\nWithered strands of hair concealed half of her face, but Li Guanqi could hear a few drops of tears fall on the mat.0\nThud!0\nSomeone kicked the door open, and the freezing wind blew into the house. The boy shivered—whether it was from the cold or fear, only he knew.0\nIt was Li Guanqi’s distant uncle, Li Dashan.0\nLi Dashan was short, and he was wearing navy blue robes. He had protruding cheekbones, downturned eyes, and a nose shaped like an eagle’s beak.0\nWith just a glance, it was enough to tell that this was no kind soul. Before he even entered, his cruel voice filled the room.0\n“You little fucker! Where’s the money?!”0\n1. One string (贯) is traditionally one thousand coins strung up together for easy counting. They are the so-called “cash coins” or qian, which have a square hole in the middle for this purpose. In this particular case, we don’t know the exact number of coins on a string, so we’ll just go with “string.” ☜\n2. Xiao (小) literally means “little.” It’s a term of endearment. ☜\n3.  zhang (丈) is a unit of measurement for distance. 1 zhang = 3.3 meters  ☜\n4. 1 li (里) = 500 meters ☜\n5. A bed-stove or kang (炕) is exactly what it sounds like: a fireplace with a stove made of bricks or hardened clay that does not reach a very high temperature and is used traditionally as a bed. ☜\nHello readers! \nWe're Doge &amp; Char, and we're working together on a brand new novel!

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 2 – The First Kill, The End of Worldly Connections",
    "content": "Li Guanqi looked down, trembling uncontrollably. He clutched the medicine in his hand and did not dare move. But the man immediately spotted Li Guanqi’s eyes, which were not covered.0\nThe man’s face darkened, and he slapped Li Guanqi so hard that he fell to the ground.0\n“Damn it! How many times have I told you to cover your eyes?! Those damn eyes bring bad luck!”0\nLi Dashan’s anger worsened when he saw the herbs scattered across the floor. He kicked the boy several times as he roared, “Did you spend money on medicine?!”0\nThe boy had experienced this treatment countless times. He wrapped his hands around his head and did his best to curl up.0\nThe crouching boy stubbornly protected the scattered medicine with his own body.0\nHearing the noise, the woman on the bed-stove stumbled to her feet and pushed Li Dashan away. She screamed, “Don’t hit him… Don’t hit my child…”1\nIn a rage, Li Dashan picked up the wooden board next to him and smashed it over her head!0\nSlam!0\n“Damn cripple! What’s the fucking point of spending money on medicine? I wish you’d die sooner! I should have sent you to the Zhao Estate as a servant when I had the chance. At least they’d pay me some money if you died!”0\nBlood flowed slowly down the woman’s forehead, but she clutched the boy protectively, begging furiously, “Don’t hit my child.”0\nLi Guanqi suddenly felt something warm and sticky on his face. Upon realizing what it was, the boy’s expression turned into a vicious snarl. He struggled as much as he could to break free from the woman’s arms. Reaching out based on memory, he instantly grabbed the cleaver on the chopping board.0\nLi Guanqi roared furiously at the man, venting all the anger he had suppressed in his heart. “Shut your mouth! If it wasn’t for your drinking and gambling addiction, would we have ended up like this?!0\n“If it wasn’t for you, would my mother still be sick after all this time? And you sold my sister to the Zhao Estate, where she worked herself to death! You’re the one who deserves to die! You! Li Dashan!”2\nFinally, there was an outlet for all the anger he had suppressed for years.0\nLi Dashan, who was still drunk, frowned even harder and scolded him, “If I hadn’t given you two food years ago, you would have long starved to death outside the city. How dare you point a knife at me now?”0\nLi Dashan looked around, searching for an object he could grab. The boy’s ear twitched slightly, then he braced himself and pounced on the man! 0\nThe cleaver glinted coldly in the moonlight that shone into the house. In a panic, Li Dashan picked up a clay jar and swung it at Li Guanqi.0\nDespite being thin and weak, the boy was agile. The moment his sensitive hearing picked up on the sound of the man lifting a heavy object, he instantly dodged sideways.0\nSlam! Crash!0\nThe clay jar shattered by Li Guanqi’s feet, along with the sound of coppers scattering on the ground. The boy froze on the spot.0\nHe knew what that sound meant.0\nThe few strings of coppers looked quite eye-catching beneath the moonlight. 0\nLi Dashan cried out excitedly, “Hahahaha! Ten strings of coppers! This will surely change my luck! This time, I will earn my money back with profit! Hahaha!”0\nLi Guanqi stood frozen in his spot, shaking uncontrollably.0\nVarious scenes flashed in his mind.0\nEver since he could remember, he had never had a full meal. He did not know who his father was because he had never met him. He heard that his father had died during the famine a long time ago.0\nAfter they moved in with this distant uncle three years ago, the real nightmare began. Li Dashan often returned home to take money from them. Once he had money, he would either drink himself to oblivion or stay a few days at the gambling den.2\nObviously, he was now here for the same purpose.0\nLi Guanqi did not know where his uncle had learned of his sister’s death, but his uncle had clearly set his sights on the ten strings of coppers.0\nSometimes, Li Guanqi would fantasize about becoming an immortal who could roam the world freely. How nice would that be? Then, perhaps he would be free from the sufferings of mortals.0\nLi Guanqi turned around. 0\nHe could still hear Li Dashan’s curses. “She’s fucking dead! Who cares if you don’t cremate her?!”0\nLi Guanqi slowly raised the cleaver in his hand.0\nThere was a flash of hesitance in Song Wanrong’s eyes, but in the end, she did not stop her brother. She had lost all hope in Li Dashan a long time ago, and she knew that she could not live for much longer. She did not want Li Dashan to sell off her son too after she died.1\nPerhaps this is… for the best.0\nPfft!0\nThe sharp cleaver sank into Li Dashan’s neck. The boy only felt a warm splatter on his face. Li Dashan collapsed in a pool of blood with disbelief in his eyes.3\nAfter experiencing such an ordeal, fatigue washed over the boy, and he slumped to the ground. 0\nSong Wanrong felt dizzy, and her vision blurred. As her body slowly turned cold, she knew that her time had come. 0\nWith great difficulty, she forced a smile onto her pale face. She called softly, “Guanqi… Come here.”0\nWhen Li Guanqi heard his mother’s voice, he quickly hurried to her side and hugged her, still trembling all over. Song Wanrong pulled him into her arms without even sparing Li Dashan a glance.0\nShe instinctively covered Li Guanqi’s eyes with her hand, stroking his back as she comforted him, “Don’t be afraid… It’s alright… His death was for the best.0\n“Come on. Let me take a good look at you.”0\nLi Guanqi’s keen senses picked up on her condition, and he immediately realized what was going on. 0\nHe looked up at his mother, sobbing uncontrollably. “Mother… Are you abandoning me too? What am I going to do…”0\nSong Wanrong’s vision grew increasingly blurred. She looked up at the snow outside the window and muttered, “I’ve been useless; you’ve suffered so much…0\n“When you grow up, be a man who stands tall and proud. Marry a wife; have a child.0\n“Your mother… will be watching you from heaven. You must… live… well. Explore the world; experience the beauty of this life.”0\nThud.0\nLi Guanqi felt the hand on his back fall weakly to the ground. He screamed with great anguish, “Mother!!!”0\nBut even after he yelled multiple times, there was no response. 0\nLi Guanqi slumped in his mother’s arms with soulless eyes, muttering, “I… don’t have a mother anymore. I don’t have any… family left.”0\nHis eyes reddened as tears streamed down his face. He did not speak. All he did was caress his mother’s face carefully, as if he wanted to burn her face into his memory.0\nA while later, the boy knocked on the door of the shop with the white cloth once more.0\nThe fat shop owner took down the board covering the entrance impatiently and saw that it was the boy who had just come over not long ago. Furious, he asked, “You again? You were here just last night, what do you want?0\n“I’m telling you, people like us in this industry are doing business out of the kindness of our hearts! The ten coppers I asked for really isn’t much!”0\nThe boy standing barefoot in the snow hung his head and said hoarsely, “My mother has died too. Could you help me carry her inside?”0\nWhen the shop owner heard that, he swallowed his words. His anger disappeared and was replaced with heartache. He pulled the boy into the building and covered him with a tattered coat his family no longer used. 0\nThen the shop owner said with a choked voice, “Warm up first… I was just putting on a coat to head out.0\n“You poor child… Your life has been so hard. If you don’t mind, come work for me. We can’t pay much, but at least you won’t starve to death.”0\nThe unexpected gesture of kindness broke through to the boy’s heart. Although he had stopped crying, he squatted on the ground and bawled again.0\n***0\nLi Guanqi felt the warmth coming from the fire burning brightly ahead. He slowly knelt and kowtowed heavily to the fire.0\n“Mother, I will never forget what you sacrificed to raise me. I will live on and live well!”4\nIn the sky above, the gray-robed old man, Su Xuan, was watching in silence.0\nAs he did some calculations with his fingers, he could not help but sigh. He muttered softly, “This was his fate. Even with me present, he would not have been able to change this fate.”5\nWhen the boy returned home through the snow, Su Xuan was standing outside his door. 0\nLi Guanqi sensed someone there, and he asked hoarsely, “Who are you looking for?”0\nThere was a twinkle in the old man’s eyes. He covered the boy’s shoulders with a thick cotton cloak. Squatting down, he held the boy’s cold, frozen hands with his large, warm ones.0\nAlthough the old man had seen all types of suffering in this realm, his heart still ached after witnessing the boy’s ordeal tonight. 0\nSu Xuan asked gently, “Child, are you willing to come with me? From today onward, I will be your grandfather, and we will leave this place.”0\nThe boy felt numb, but he also felt a warmth he had never felt before from those hands. Tears flowed instantly from his eyes. With a trembling voice, he asked, “Will I get food to eat…?”1\nSu Xuan’s heart ached, then he pulled the boy into his arms and said in a low voice, “Yes! But that’s not all. You’ll be full after every meal and get warm clothes too!”0\nThe boy nodded. There was nothing tying him to his place; all he had to do was bury his loved ones. 0\nAnd so he did, placing them in graves with headstones on the outskirts of the isolated town.0\nTen strings of coppers were buried together with his mother’s ashes in the grave. Li Guanqi only kept one coin in his pocket as a memento of her.3"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 3 – Opening The Heart’s Eye!",
    "content": "At the peak of a tall mountain, there was a village called Prosperity Village.0\nIn a small but elegant courtyard, a handsome young man sat cross-legged in the center. He was wearing clean white robes, and an ordinary copper coin hung from his neck, secured by a red string.2\nA small and thin old man was smoking away nearby, watching the youth with a twinkle in his eyes.0\nOpening the heart’s eye is especially difficult. I hope he succeeds this time!0\nLi Guanqi chanted the sutra silently in his heart, his mind entering a profound state.0\nWith a clear heart, even a speck of dust can be seen. When there is no attachment in your mind, you will find clarity.1\nMyriad paths return to one source through the eyes. When your intrusive thoughts vanish, enlightenment will appear instead. 0\nSit quietly, focus your mind, and count your heartbeats. When light shines in your heart, it will slowly reflect the whole cosmos. 0\nForget perceptions and attain true essence. When your heart’s eye opens, it will reveal the workings of heaven. 0\nThe sutra that his grandfather had taught him echoed constantly in his head. As the external distractions faded, his mind grew calm and peaceful, like a still pond. His consciousness sank into his surroundings.0\nA while later, Li Guanqi saw thick white fog in his mind.0\nIt nearly shattered his concentration. For the first time ever, he saw something other than pitch-black darkness!1\nVery quickly, he calmed his mind and chanted the sutra in his mind repeatedly. He felt like this was the closest he had ever gotten to opening his heart’s eye.0\nIn his subconscious, Li Guanqi walked toward the fog. It was as if an invisible wall was blocking him.0\nHe calmed himself and strode forward with great determination. His blood and qi surged instantly within him. The sand and dust on the ground around him started to vibrate slightly.0\nSmoke obscured the old man’s face, but his smile was still visible.0\n“His Empty Spirit Physique is impressive… It only took him seven days to open his heart’s eye… With such talent, he will be a great prodigy the world has never seen before.”0\nBefore the old man could finish his sentence, Li Guanqi’s veins suddenly popped and strained against the skin of his neck. His mind cleared; he had broken out of the mist!0\nBoom!0\nThe sound of something shattering rang in his mind. Suddenly, Li Guanqi’s expression turned to shock as his qi gradually calmed down.0\nHe could finally see…3\nAlthough there was no color, his heart’s eye could see everything like regular human eyes.0\nSu Xuan, the old man, nodded. Before his sea of consciousness is fully formed, this heart’s eye will suffice.0\nLi Guanqi looked around the elegantly built courtyard. This was his first time seeing it.0\n“Grandfather?”0\nSu Xuan smiled. He rose to his feet, placed his hands behind his back, and asked smilingly, “Can you see now?”0\nLi Guanqi was incredibly overwhelmed. He nodded vigorously with reddened eyes. Although he could not see color, simply being able to see was enough to overwhelm him.0\nSu Xuan patted his shoulder and said with a smile, “Haha. Don’t worry. In the future, when you attain divine consciousness, you’ll naturally be able to see the colors of the world. However, since you have only just opened your heart’s eye, it’s best if you use it sparingly, as it will use up a lot of spirit energy. Come, come. Come here. I’ve prepared something good for you.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded slightly and committed Su Xuan’s words to memory. After he rose, he stood and stared for a long time.0\nHe looked at his hands and feet, then he pored over the copper coin tied around his neck.0\nHe held it in his hand. So… this is a copper coin…4\nLi Guanqi followed Su Xuan to the backyard. When he noticed the pungent medicinal bathwater in the bathtub, he pursed his lips and asked, “Do I still need a bath today?”0\nNonetheless, he still took his shirt off. Clearly, this was not his first time.0\nThe Su Xuan just smiled mysteriously and continued walking inside. “You’re not taking a bath now. Come here.”0\nWithout a word, Li Guanqi followed behind Su Xuan. Soon, he saw a rectangular stone pillar about as tall as Li Guanqi with a few hemp ropes tied around it.0\nThe corner of Li Guanqi’s mouth twitched. Looking at the ropes, he blurted, “Grandfather… You’re not asking me to carry this on my back, are you?”0\nSu Xuan did not respond. He merely looked at Li Guanqi with a smile.0\nLi Guanqi shrugged. He went up to the stone pillar and looped the ropes around his shoulders. He braced his core and back, and the stone pillar was lifted off the ground!0\nLi Guanqi’s face swelled and turned red as he stuttered, “G-grandfather! T-this thing is a-at least five hundred jin[1]! I’m a-afraid… i-it’s quite difficult to carry…”0\nSu Xuan smiled and said, “So what if it’s five hundred jin? You’ve reached peak Body Tempering, and five hundred is not heavy. From now on, you shall carry this on your back as you eat, sleep, and as you travel up and down the mountain!”0\nLi Guanqi did not complain. All he did was ask, “What about when I’m practicing my punching routine?”0\nSu Xuan turned and smiled. “You’ll still be carrying it, of course. Carry it even when you’re sleeping.”0\nLi Guanqi had no choice but to obey him despite not knowing the reason for doing this.0\nAt sunset, Su Xuan left to play chess in the village. Before he left, his eyes darted at Li Guanqi as he muttered, “This is for your own good, brat…”0\n***0\nEarly the next morning, Su Xuan seemed to be busy preparing something. Li Guanqi, who was carrying the stone pillar on his back, hiked up the mountain from its base, huffing and puffing.0\nOn mornings like this one, the time between waking up and breakfast was playtime for the village youths. When breakfast was ready, women wearing flowery coats opened their yard doors and shouted their children’s names at the top of their lungs.0\n“You brat! Time for food!”0\n“Cuihua~ Time to come home.”0\n“Chenchen, you’d better come home this instant!”0\nA teenager named Zhao Beichen was hiding in a dark corner, waiting for his target to arrive. He was watching the youth with venomous hatred in his eyes. Meng Wanshu had a cold attitude toward everyone except Li Guanqi, whom she was willing to chat with a little more.0\nBut as far as Zhao Beichen was concerned, Meng Wanshu was going to be his future wife! What right did that stupid blind guy have to take his woman?!0\nBecause of this, during the past few years, Zhao Beichen often came to Li Guanqi looking for trouble. Unfortunately, he would always end up getting beaten up by Li Guanqi.1\nWhat made today different was that Li Guanqi had now opened his heart’s eye. Nevertheless, even if he could not see Zhao Beichen, the young man’s breath was as heavy as a bull’s in his ears.0\nWhen Zhao Beichen spotted his chance, he slipped out, raised his fist, and swung it at Li Guanqi. All Li Guanqi did was dodge sideways slightly, then he punched Zhao Beichen’s stomach.0\nThe intense pain caused Zhao Beichen to squat on the ground, clutching his abdomen in pain. He pointed at Li Guanqi and cried shakily, “Li… Guanqi! You bastard! Just you wait for two more years!”0\nLi Guanqi squatted and smirked with amusement. “It doesn’t matter how many years pass; it’ll be the same. You’ll never beat me.”0\nWhen the boys nearby saw Li Guanqi get up and look at them, they cried out in a panic, “I… I’m going home. My mother’s calling me.”1\nAfter the few boys left, Li Guanqi left Zhao Beichen lying on the ground. He had long set his sights beyond Prosperity Village. 0\nAs for Zhao Beichen… Fortunately, he had not thought of using weapons yet, or Li Guanqi would have killed him a long time ago.0\nLi Guanqi wrinkled his nose and followed a delicious fragrance to its source. When he arrived, he climbed up a house’s garden wall and asked, “Auntie Li~ What’s the occasion? Is that a braised hen?”0\nCreak~0\nA slightly plump, middle-aged woman pushed the door open and waved at him with a smile. “It’s you, Guanqi! Have you eaten? Let me give you some.”0\nLooking at the smiling woman, Li Guanqi thought to himself, So this is what Auntie Li looks like…0\nLi Guangqi rubbed his belly dramatically and said, “I haven’t, actually. Blame my dog-like nose. I didn’t want to eat the wild vegetables my grandfather cooked, so I followed the smell and arrived here.”0\nThe woman quickly waved him off and said, “Don’t say such things, boy.[2] You came at the right time. I’ve got half a pot left.”0\nThe youth’s smile widened even more. He thanked her sweetly, “Thank you, Auntie Li. Sigh… With your talent in cooking, it would be such a waste if you don’t leave this mountain to open a restaurant.”0\nThe woman squinted, and a few more wrinkles appeared around her eyes. “I know you’re trying to sweet-talk me. Wait here.”1\nAfter a while, a beautiful teenage girl wearing a light blue dress emerged, holding a full, fragrant pot of braised chicken. Afraid to spill it, she kept her eyes fixed on the pot.0\nAs she walked, she complained, “Li Guanqi, are you a dog? Why are you so punctual every time my family cooks something good?”0\nI see now… Wanshu really is beautiful.  With that thought, the corners of his lips curled up. He chuckled and said, “Meng Wanshu, who do you think will get to marry a domestic goddess like you when you’re older?”5\nMeng Wanshu’s tiny face reddened. With great effort, she was finally able to lift the pot up to the top of the garden wall.0\nShe rolled her eyes at him and then ran into the house. However, when she realized the blind youth wasn’t able to see her rolling her eyes, she pursed her lips, looked up, and cursed, “You blind idiot!”0\nLi Guanqi laughed and turned around. However, he did not leave. Instead, he stood up and bowed slightly before saying awkwardly, “Uh… Uncle Meng… You’re back?”0\nThe man standing in front of Li Guanqi did not speak; he merely kicked Li Guanqi’s bottom.0\nWith a smile, he chided Li Guanqi, “Don’t tease Wanshu so much. You’re coming of age soon, and you’re still not serious at all. Get out of here, brat~”0\nLi Guanqi chuckled. He quickly nodded and said, “Alright~ I’ll bring you some wine tomorrow, Uncle Meng.”0\nThen, he strolled over to a house that was slightly further away. After pushing the door open, Li Guanqi called gently, “Grandfather? I’m home.”0\nSu Xuan, who was smoking a pipe by the door, lit up when he saw the youth. Smacking his lips together, he said, “I’ve always said that Old Meng’s wife is the best cook.”0\nWhen Li Guanqi put down the pot, Su Xuan slapped his head, and he almost fell. 0\nSu Xuan pursed his lips and huffed, “You’ve only just opened your heart’s eye, and you’re already using it for such things? One hundred more rounds of punches for you today!”0\nLi Guanqi grimaced but did not dare fight back. “You controlled your strength well today. If you had hit any harder, I’d have to pay Old Zhao a visit tomorrow.”0\nHe rubbed his head and did not say anything for a long time after that.0\nBurp~0\n“I’m done eating,” Su Xuan said.0\nLi Guanqi suddenly sensed that something was off. He poked around the pot with his chopsticks. For a while, only the clinking sounds of his chopsticks and the pot could be heard.0\nHe asked, “Are you going to play chess with Old Lu again?”0\n“It’s none of your business. Focus on your practice! I’m going to the mountains to look for something. I’ll be back in two days. Remember to buy me some wine when you go down the mountain tomorrow.”0\nLi Guanqi sulked and inhaled large mouthfuls of rice until not a single grain remained.0\nAfter he was done eating, he went to the backyard, took off his clothes, and then sat in the bathtub. The ink-green medicinal bath constantly prickled his skin. In just a few breaths’ time, the youth’s skin had turned completely red, and beads of sweat started to sprout from his forehead.0\nHe trembled, clenching his teeth hard as if he was suffering from extreme pain. Through the ink-green medicine, many mysterious patterns that densely covered his body could be seen.0\nLi Guanqi had only opened his heart’s eye yesterday. Although he could only “see” in black and white, it was still an incredible gift. He had exhausted his mental energy to open his heart’s eye, as he treasured being able to distinguish between day and night.0\nLi Guanqi sat in the bathtub, silently bearing the pain brought by the medicinal bath. He was thinking about what he would do after completing his punching practice.0\n***0\nHis fists whistled through the air. Finally, he completed the last repetition of his routine.0\nLi Guanqi opened his heart’s eye and realized that it was already past midnight. He furrowed his brow.0\n“Why hasn’t Grandfather returned yet?”1\nLi Guanqi did not think much of it. He lay on his bed and soon fell asleep.0\nThe next morning, he still did not see his grandfather. He decided to descend the mountain to buy some wine.0\nSometimes, his grandfather spent days in the mountains, so he had grown accustomed to this. Li Guanqi hummed a small tune as he descended the mountain.0\nMeanwhile, another friend of his had also descended the mountain.1\n1. 1 jin (斤) = 0.5-0.6kg depending on which country in Eastern Asia you’re in. In China, it’s standardized as 0.5kg. ☜0\n2. “Eating wild vegetables” is slang for living a poor life. ☜0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 4 – Guanqi Descends the Mountain, Meets an “Old Friend”!",
    "content": "The road leading down the mountain away from Prosperity Village was narrow and treacherous, but to Li Guanqi, it might as well have been flat land.0\nHe had lost count of how many times he had traveled on this road. Almost everyone in the village who drank relied on him to buy wine from the town below.0\nThe descent was quick, and he had almost reached Changxing Town by noon. 0\nLi Guanqi breathed deeply. Beads of sweat had sprouted from his forehead. A smile spread across his face as he gazed at the town still a few kilometers away. 0\n“I’m finally here, and I'm much faster than before. I've improved once again!”1\nThen, he shot off to town like an arrow.0\n***0\nChangxing Town was a large town with more than two hundred thousand people.0\nIt was a market day, so the town was much busier than usual, filled with the shouts of vendors across the streets.0\nA girl wearing a light blue dress was looking around the place. Her dress had been washed so many times that it was turning white.0\nThe girl was Meng Wanshu. She was carrying the rice, flour, and oil she had bought. 0\nMeng Wanshu had begged her parents for a long time before they finally allowed her to leave the mountain and go into town.0\n“Uncle, how much is this rice cake?”0\n“One copper, young lady.”0\n“So cheap? Give me three, no… four pieces.”0\nMeng Wanshu muttered something to herself, and an image of the freeloader who always ate free food at her house appeared in her mind.0\nThe moment she thought of the blind boy, Meng Wanshu stomped her foot in anger. “Hmmph! With that dog nose of his, he’ll sniff it out and demand to know why I didn’t buy him any.”0\nThe old man quickly wrapped the sticky rice cakes in paper.0\nAfter taking the rice cakes, Meng Wanshu thanked him and walked happily out of town.0\nMeanwhile, Li Guanqi was about four or five li away from Changxing Town, unaware that Meng Wanshu had also descended the mountain and gone into town.0\nSuddenly, Meng Wanshu heard cries of panic and surprise from the street behind her.0\nShe saw a young man with skin as smooth as jade. He wore luxurious white-blue robes and flapped his paper fan slowly, arrogance shining in his eyes.1\nHis brows were slightly furrowed. Occasionally, he would shoot a disgusted glare at the elderly, white-haired rice cake seller.0\nFour or five servants protected the young man while he stood in the middle. They moved in unison to overturn the old man’s rice cake stall, stomping the steaming hot rice cakes to mush.2\nThe old man kneeled on the ground with reddened eyes, reaching out as he tried frantically to protect the cakes.0\n“Don’t… Don’t step… Don’t step on them… These were freshly made!”0\nCrash!0\nThe cruel servants tackled him to the ground. One of them threatened cruelly, “You old bastard! Did you think you could open a stall here without paying up? Don’t you know that the Zhao Clan has bought this area?”0\nHis remark instantly attracted a lot of dissent from the crowd, but the insults died down quickly. The gangsters glared at everyone who spoke, so they had no choice but to shut their mouths.0\nAmidst the crowd, Meng Wanshu recognized the old man as the seller from whom she had just bought rice cakes. She frowned in anger, but when she glanced at the young man, she knew she could not say anything.0\nShe recalled a piece of advice the blind boy had given her once. It was best to avoid trouble and mind her own business when she was away from home. Meng Wanshu knew she could not change anything, so she sighed, turned around, and walked away.3\nBut when she turned, Zhao Yuanlin spotted her.0\nInitially, he had resented his father deeply for sending him to this faraway place. However, he was surprised to see such a graceful-looking girl here.0\nThis girl was only thirteen or fourteen years of age, but she was already a budding beauty. There was an innocence in her eyes that made her completely different from the whores Zhao Yuanlin usually spent his days with.0\nZhou Yuanlin said, “Gou San, I want that girl tonight. Follow her!”1\nGou San, a thin and short servant with beady, mouse-like eyes, looked up at Meng Wanshu from a distance and instantly knew what to do.0\nBased on the girl’s clothes and the items in her hands, it was clear she was not from a wealthy family. Girls from regular families like her were the easiest to deal with.0\nGou San bowed. The smile on his face did not hide his perverted thoughts. 0\nHe quickly nodded and smiled in an ingratiating manner. “Don’t worry, Young Master! I’ll get it done right away!”0\nThe corners of Zhao Yuan’s lips curved upward as his heartbeat quickened. He was already fantasizing about what would happen next.0\nHe slapped his fan on Gou San’s head and chuckled. “Get it done well.”0\nAs he spoke, he took out a large golden ingot and tossed it at Gou San. “Whatever is left over is yours.”0\nGou San’s eyes lit up, and he quickly nodded. 0\nHe yelled at the crowd of bystanders, “Get lost! Nothing to see here! Go home!”0\nAfter Zhao Yuanlin left, Gou San straightened his posture and kicked the old man’s cart over with a smirk. “The rent is three strings of coppers per month. Don't open your stall here if you don’t want to pay up. I’ll knock it down every time you try!”0\nThe old man’s hair was a mess. He wiped his face haphazardly, but there was still blood on his face. 0\nDespite that, he said reluctantly, “S-sir… wasn’t it one string per month previously? H-how… H-how could it go up by so much after just two days?”0\nGou San scooped up the rice cake mush that had been stepped on and stuffed it into the old man’s mouth. He cocked his head and growled with a cruel glare, “One string? Heh, my brothers need to eat, don’t they?”0\nHumiliated, the old man swallowed the dirt-covered rice cake and nodded vigorously. “Yes, yes… I understand…”0\n“Hahahaha, that was funny, Brother Gou.”0\n“He doesn’t know what’s good for him. Brother Gou, what did Young Master say just now?”0\nGou San smiled and dangled the golden ingot in front of them. “Didn’t we catch an old lady who was a pimp in the city recently?”0\n“What was her name again? Auntie Mei? Go get her. And you over there, think of a way to stall the girl.”0\nOnce the others heard his orders, they immediately set off to work. 0\nGou San bared his yellow teeth. His hunched back made him look especially perverted as he licked his lips. 0\nHe had spotted that girl way before Zhao Yuanlin. If it weren’t for Zhao Yuanlin, he would have gotten to enjoy her instead.0\nHowever… with Zhao Yuanlin’s personality, his fellow brothers may have a chance later on!0\n“Hehe, how pretty…” 0\nSoon after, Meng Wanshu realized that something was wrong. It seemed like no matter where she went, someone would block her way, and she could not shake them off.0\nPanic began to creep over her.0\nIn a dark alley, Gou San furrowed his brows when he saw an old lady with a kind face before him. He turned to the man next to him and asked, “Are you sure this is that Auntie Mei? Based on her kind face, you really can’t tell…”0\nThe old lady explained gently, “You don’t understand, sir. If I didn’t look like this… How could so many people have fallen for my traps? Exploiting pity—that’s the foundation of my business.”0\nGou San looked amused and got straight to the point. “Then I’ll leave this matter to you. Once the deal is done, you’ll get thirty taels of silver.” 0\nThe old woman's eyes shone, and she quickly nodded.0\nFrom the bag slung over her back, she pulled out a set of tattered, foul-smelling clothes and changed into them. She then ruffled her hands through her neat hair and rubbed her hands on the ground, making sure to get grime beneath her nails. Finally, she smeared the dirt on her face too. 0\nGou San looked at the old woman again. The difference was like heaven and earth.0\nBefore, she looked like a senior member of a great clan. Now, she was an old woman who had fallen on hard times. Even a seasoned crook like Gou San could not help but give her a thumbs-up for her impressive transformation.0\n***0\nLi Guanqi, who had just arrived in town, ran to the wine shop excitedly. 0\nContrary to what one might expect, the plump middle-aged shopkeeper was not rude. Instead, he greeted Li Guanqi warmly and said, “Haha! Little blind boy, you haven’t been here in a long time!”0\nWhen Li Guanqi heard the shopkeeper’s warm greeting, he replied, “Boss Zhao, your business seems to be doing well! You’ve gotten a lot fatter!”0\nBoss Zhao of the wine shop was not offended by Li Guanqi’s words. In fact, Li Guanqi was an important person to him. Ever since Li Guanqi started buying wine from him, his business improved and even expanded.0\nAnd just like that, after a few interactions, Boss Zhao, whose name was Zhao Dafu, gradually became well-aquainted with Li Guanqi. 0\nZhao Dafu passed Li Guanqi some sunflower seeds and asked, “The usual?”0\nLi Guanqi thought momentarily and remembered that he also promised Uncle Meng some wine. He ordered generously, “Four jars[1] of osmanthus wine.”0\nZhao Dafu nodded with a grin and exclaimed in a booming voice, “Old customer! Four jars of osmanthus wine!”0\nUpon hearing his Zhao Dafu’s nickname for him, Li Guanqi said, “Tsk, you even added the phrase ‘old customer’! What’s up with that? Afraid your assistant might add water to dilute my order?”0\nStartled, Zhao Dafu quickly waved his hand, brushing off the possibility. “Don’t say that! I wouldn’t dare! I, Zhao Dafu, have always relied on my customers’ trust to keep my business alive. I only said that for fun…”0\nWhile waiting for the shop assistant to prepare his order, Li Guanqi munched on sunflower seeds at the counter and made small talk with Zhao Dafu. Through the gaps in the crowd outside, he spotted an old man picking up the pieces of a ruined stall, causing him to frown.0\nLi Guanqi turned to Zhao Dafu and asked in a low voice, “Old Zhao, what happened to Uncle Xiao? Why did someone wreck his stall?”0\nZhao Dafu sighed. He, too, had witnessed the conflict between Uncle Xiao and the gangsters.1\nHis wine shop had remained unaffected so far because of its higher status in the community, but he couldn’t help but sigh. 0\n“Haaa… It’s been a headache. Recently, a clan with the surname Zhao bought three of the streets in this area, including this one. With that, the rent more than doubled overnight! Now, the shops around here, including ours, are thinking of moving away.”0\nLi Guanqi frowned. Narrowing his eyes, he muttered to himself, “The Zhao Clan?” 0\nHowever, he did not dwell on it further and continued listening to Zhao Dafu’s brief explanation. Ultimately, he said angrily, “That’s ridiculous! Aren’t they afraid that you all will break your leases and move away?”0\nZhao Dafu crossed his arms and huffed, “Who knows what they're thinking? I am already preparing to move. I’ll move even if the new place's rent is only slightly lower than this. How could anyone survive with such exorbitant costs?!” 0\n“Boss, the four jars of osmanthus wine are ready.”0\nLi Guanqi eyed the jars, which were noticeably smaller than before, and blurted, “Come on! Instead of decreasing the quality, you decreased the quantity?!” 0\nZhao Dafu rubbed his hands awkwardly and refunded part of the cash Li Guanqi paid him. “Haaa, I don’t have much choice, do I?” 0\nLi Guanqi took the money, shook the jar of wine, and then advised him, “Old Zhao, you can’t run your business like that… Anyway, I’ll go check on Uncle Xiao.”0\nLooking guilty, Zhao Dafu sighed again. Then he turned to his assistant and said, “Change them!” 0\n“Huh? Change what?” 0\n“The jars! What else could I have meant, you fool…” 0\n“Oh, oh! Understood! By the way, I was watching just now, and I think that girl in the blue dress will likely end up in trouble…”0\n“Shut your mouth! Do not say anything you’re not supposed to!”0\nZhao Dafu glanced around cautiously. Although he dared vent to Li Guanqi, it did not mean he dared offend the Zhao Clan. 0\nLi Guanqi stopped in his tracks and turned to face the assistant with a frown. He asked, “What girl in the blue dress? What happened?”0\n1. Wines are traditionally fermented in terracotta, porcelain or ceramic jars. ☜0"

    "content": "Zhao Dafu walked out of the shop to wave Li Guanqi inside. Then, he pulled Li Guanqi to the back of the shop and explained briefly. 0\nNarrowing his eyes, Li Guanqi clenched his fists. “No… It shouldn’t be her… Wanshu has never left the mountain before!” 0\nHe looked up at Zhao Dafu and asked solemnly, “Did you see her face? How tall was she?” 0\nZhao Dafu furrowed his brows. He thought for a long time before gesturing next to Li Guanqi’s ear. “About this tall. She looked decent enough, but I couldn’t see her face clearly. It was only a brief moment.”0\nSensing that Li Guanqi might know the girl, Zhao Dafu reassured him, saying, “That girl left a long time ago. She has probably left town by now.”0\nHowever, the shop assistant, who was standing at the counter, muttered, “Not necessarily. Gou San is the worst kind of lecher. He obeys his young master like a dog, so I think…” 0\nThe shop assistant shook his head. He did not finish his sentence. 0\nLi Guanqi carried the jars on a shoulder pole and left to speak to the old man whose rice cakes had been stomped. He was just outside the shop. 0\n“Uncle Xiao! It’s me.” 0\nThe old man looked up slowly with tears in his eyes. He wiped his eyes with his sleeves, clearing his vision so he could see Li Guanqi properly. “Oh, it’s you, Xiao Li. Look at this… I… Sigh…”   1\nLi Guanqi asked, “Did a girl buy rice cakes from you just now? About thirteen or fourteen years old, a little shorter than me? Wearing a dress with white flowers embroidered on her sleeves?” 0\nThe old man recounted the day’s events and recalled Meng Wanshu, who’d bought four rice cakes from him. “Yes, yes! There was a girl like what you described! That girl initially ordered three pieces, then decided to order four instead. I had to repack them. I remember clearly.”0\nLi Guanqi’s heart sank. He had confirmed that Zhao Yuanlin had set his eyes on Meng Wanshu. 0\nHis mind raced as he grabbed the old man’s shoulder and asked, “Which direction did she go?”0\nBut how could the old man remember such a detail? He did not even know that Meng Wanshu was still in the crowd when the commotion broke out.0\n“To the eastern part of town!” the assistant in the shop called out, pointing toward the east. 1\nLi Guanqi nodded and dashed into the crowd without having time to thank them.0\n***0\nMeng Wanshu sighed in relief as she anxiously hurried out of town. She needed to get home before nightfall. If there were any more delays, her parents would be worried sick.0\nShe had not walked far when she saw an old woman lying weakly on the ground by the road. Ignoring the old woman, she clenched her teeth and quickened her footsteps.0\nOut of nowhere, the old woman clutched the hem of Meng Wanshu’s dress with all her strength. Her lips were cracked and her face was pale, obvious signs of severe starvation and dehydration. 0\nGripping Meng Wanshu’s dress with a withered and trembling hand, she stuttered, “Miss… s-spare me some… food...”0\nAs she spoke, the old woman even fished out a jade bangle wrapped in tattered cloth from her pocket and handed it to Meng Wanshu. “This bangle is mine… Miss, just give me something to eat.”0\nTears welled up in the old woman’s eyes, giving her a pitiful look. Meng Wanshu could not bear to let the old woman starve on the street, so she took out a piece of rice cake from the wax paper wrap. 0\nShe had no choice because the old woman was gripping too tightly. If she didn’t give her some food, she would not be able to leave. 0\nMeng Wanshu told the old woman, “I’ll give this to you. You can let go now.”0\nThe old woman grabbed the rice cake and wolfed it down, yet she didn’t let go. 0\nMeng Wanshu tugged hard on the hem of her skirt in a panic and said sternly, “I’ve already given you food. Let go…” 0\nThe old woman forced the jade bangle onto Meng Wanshu’s hand. 0\n“Ahh!! It hurts… I don’t want it! Take it back!” 0\nThere was a flicker of light in the old woman’s eyes. Then, she finally let go of Meng Wanshu’s hand and spat out the rice cake. “You should keep it, girl.”0\nJust then, someone yelled from an alley, “Mother! Where are you?”0\nThe rough voices of men emerged from the dark depths of the alley, gradually growing louder. 0\nOne of them called out teasingly, “That bangle was supposed to be for my future wife.” 0\nMeng Wanshu immediately realized what was happening, and her expression changed to one of alarm.0\nShe dropped the things she was holding and desperately tried to tug the bangle off. Her wrist turned red from the friction, but it wouldn’t budge.0\nAs she struggled to tug it off, a silhouette slowly emerged from the darkness. It was a group of five men, and the leader was none other than Gou San, the lecher.0\nGou San laughed, “Hahaha! Mother, is that the wife you found for me?” 0\nMeng Wanshu quickly stumbled backward as she eyed them with terror. However, a few of the men had already blocked off any possible paths she could take. 0\nMeng Wanshu cried out sternly, “I am not! Don’t say that!”0\nGou San crossed his arms and looked at her wrist with a smile. “Oh? Why not? You have our family heirloom on your wrist.” 0\nGou San walked up to her, and his eyes darted greedily to her chest. 0\nHis disgusting behavior made Meng Wanshu turn pale.0\nAlthough many local residents peeked their heads out to check on the commotion, no one dared to speak up. 0\nAuntie Mei, who was still pretending to be a poor old lady, addressed the audience in a pitiful tone. “This young lady promised to marry into our family, and she even accepted our family heirloom. But now, she has changed her mind…” 0\nThe people around them erupted with discussions.0\n“Kids these days… She has already agreed to it, so how could she change her mind?” 0\n“Yeah! That bangle on her wrist looks like it’s worth a lot of money too.” 0\n“Sigh… Gou San is an orphan; where did this ‘mother’ come from? The girl has been tricked…”0\nWhile many were aware of the truth, her words successfully deceived the majority of the crowd.0\nAntue Mei hung her head low. Her messy hair covered the sly look in her eyes. She was already contemplating whether she should secretly move away after receiving her payment. 0\nThere was a flash of determination in Meng Wanshu’s eyes. Suddenly, she lifted her hand and smashed it hard against a rock on the ground! 0\nGou San felt a wave of terror wash over him. The bangle was extremely valuable, and it belonged to Zhao Yuanlin. 0\nHe yelled, “Stop it! Don’t you dare!” 0\nMeng Wanshu ignored him. 0\nThud! Crack! 0\nThe expensive jade bangle shattered into pieces, the shards slicing deep into her wrist. Blood gushed out, pouring out so quickly it was impossible to tell exactly where the wound was. She got up, panting heavily as adrenaline coursed through her. 0\nGou San looked at the shattered jade bangle. His face gradually darkened. Then, he took a large step forward and slapped her across her face. 0\n“You stupid bitch! I tried being nice, but you just can’t tell what’s good for you!”0\nMeng Wanshu fell on the cold, stony ground. The skin on both her hands broke from the friction, and her cheek swelled with a five-fingered mark. 0\nWhen the crowd saw Gou San hit her, their discussions died down. His menacing aura made many of them take a few steps away from him. 0\nMeng Wanshu looked around with a pained expression. Her lips parted, about to beg for help, but there was no sound. 0\nThe cold crowd did not dare meet Gou San’s eyes. He looked around coldly, and many people even walked away from the scene. 0\nHe chuckled and squatted down, looking at Meng Wanshu’s reddened eyes. “That jade bangle was worth three hundred taels of silver. Either you pay up, or you become my wife!” 0\nBut Meng Wanshu wasn’t the kind to break easily. She refused to show any sign of weakness in front of him. Despite the stinging pain on her cheek and the waves of pain coming from her hands, she lifted her chin defiantly. 0\n“In your fucking dreams! I’d rather smash my head right here and die than go with you!”0\nGou San burst into laughter. “Hehe, this little bitch is quite a spicy one. Come, my brothers! Take her away!”0\nBefore they could move, Meng Wanshu picked up the bloodied rock on the ground and swung it at Gou San’s face!0\nThud! 0\nBlood flew in all directions, and the bridge of Gou San’s nose collapsed. His face was a mess of blood and flesh. 0\nMeng Wanshu got up and tried to run, but one of the servants, a young man in the Zhao Mansion’s uniform, grabbed her hair and pushed her to the ground. “Still trying to run?!”0\nThe servant turned to look at Gou San. “Brother Gou, are you alright?” 0\nMeng Wanshu struggled as hard as she could. “Let me go! Let me go!” 0\nHowever, she was too weak to resist the servant who held her down. She could not break free despite struggling as hard as she could. 0\nSomeone helped Gou San up. Blood had blurred his vision, and the intense pain coming from his nose made him lose all reason. 0\n“I’m going to kill you!” 0\nHe reached into his sleeve and pulled out a dagger, but two hands shot out to stop him. 0\n“Brother Gou! Brother Gou! Don’t do it… If you hurt her, we won’t be able to explain it to Young Master Zhao!” 0\nGou San returned to his senses and glared at Meng Wanshu. 0\nHis chest rose and fell as he panted heavily. Licking away the blood on his lips, he said coldly, “You bitch… Just you wait! Once Young Master is finished with you, I’ll have my turn! Take her away!” 1\nMeng Wanshu panicked. Despair filled her. 0\n“Save me! I’m begging you all! Save me! I don’t know them! They’re in cahoots with that old lady! I only gave her something to eat! The old woman forced the bangle on me! Save me!”0\nDespite her desperate cries for help, no one pitied her enough to save her. Furthermore, no one was brave enough to offend the Zhao Clan. 0\nNo one reacted to her cries. 0\nThe group of men shoved their way through the crowd brazenly and headed toward the town. Although Meng Wanshu did her best to drag her feet on the ground, she was no match for their strength.0\nSuddenly, Meng Wanshu spotted someone she was very familiar with… 0\nHer tense nerves instantly unraveled, and her grimace turned into a begging look. Tears poured from her eyes as she pursed her lips, trying her best not to make a sound. 0\nThe hearts of the bystanders ached at the sight of this beautiful girl crying so pitifully.0\nStanding ten zhang away was Li Guanqi, his expression incredibly dark. Rage coursed through him when he saw her bloody wrist and the finger marks on her cheek. His hands and legs tingled, and the surge of blood made the blood vessels in his eyes stand out.0\nGou San frowned when he saw Li Guanqi. He took out the dagger from his sleeve and strode forward slowly. “Where did this beggar come from? Get lost. Mind your own fucking business.” 0\nLi Guanqi’s lips trembled. He muttered to himself, “Grandfather, you can scold me later…”0\nHe glanced at Meng Wanshu warmly, forcing a friendly smile.0\n“Wanshu, close your eyes. Open them only when I tell you to.” 0\nMeng Wanshu nodded vigorously and slowly shut her eyes. 0\nLi Guanqi slowly put the jars of wine down and cracked his knuckles. Seeing Meng Wanshu hurt made a wave of killing intent surge uncontrollably through him.0\nAlthough some people in Prosperity Village were annoying, many of them were genuinely kind to him. Meng Wanshu might have scolded him every day, but she always made sure he got a share of the delicious meals from her home.0\nGou San looked at Li Guanqi with disgust and waved. “Cripple him!” 0\nThe stinging pain from his nose had made him irritable, and Li Guanqi’s timely appearance had given him an outlet for his rage. 0\nThree men swarmed Li Guanqi. 0\nBut suddenly, a dull thud rang out.0"

The realization came too late, however. 0\nTen zhang away, the crowd saw Li Guanqi shoot toward Gou San, moving so quickly he was only a shadow. Li Guanqi crouched to dodge Gou San’s dagger, then he threw a punch as heavy as a hammer at Gou San’s jaw. 0\nCrack! The sound of his jaw breaking filled the air. 0\nLi Guanqi had struck with terrifying fury, shattering Gou San’s jaw and throwing him into the air.0\nUsing his left hand, he crushed the bones in Gou San’s right hand, snatched his dagger, and stabbed him three times in a row. 0\nDespite the warm blood spraying his face, Li Guanqi maintained a calm expression. He had intended to kill from the moment he started moving. 1\nGou San trembled uncontrollably. His eyes widened as his pupils dilated in fear. Even as life drained from him, he still could not believe what happened… 0\n“Ah!!! Brother Gou!”0\nLi Guanqi held the dagger in his right hand, its blade turned toward himself. In a flash, he appeared in front of his next target. 0\nTerror flashed across the man’s face. Then, as if trying to muster some courage, he punched out in anger.0\n“Die!” 0\nLi Guanqi punched the approaching fist! The impact fractured the man’s arm, making a bone protrude through his bleeding skin.0\nLi Guanqi stepped forward and flipped his dagger forward, thrusting it into the bottom of the man’s jaw. He leaped into the air, kicked the man’s head, pulled out the dagger, and flung it behind him. 0\nPfft! 0\nThe sharp dagger plunged in between a third man’s brows. 0\nThe moment Li Guanqi landed, he pulled out his dagger and dashed in Meng Wanshu’s direction. 0\nHis movements were so fluid that he had killed three men within a few breaths’ time. Terrified, the crowd dispersed at once. 0\nLi Guanqi had remained calm throughout the entire incident, unaffected emotionally despite having killed three people. All this was thanks to Su Xuan’s mentorship and discipline. 0\nMeng Wanshu heard the screams and thuds but did not know what was happening. Although the panicking crowd startled her, she remembered Li Guanqi’s words and kept her eyes closed. 0\nSuddenly, she felt the hand pressing on her left shoulder lift. The man was thrown back like a gunny sack, even breaking a door behind him. He never got up again. 0\nRealizing the severity of the situation, the final man took out a stick of bamboo and lit it up. Sparks instantly shot thirty zhang into the air.0\nLi Guanqi narrowed his eyes. “Fireworks…”0\nHe broke the man’s arm with a punch and then slit his throat, the dagger glinting coldly as it sliced across the man’s throat.0\nMeng Wanshu’s breathing quickened, but suddenly, the sounds around her quietened significantly. When she was about to say something, she heard Li Guanqi’s gentle voice. 0\n“I’m done. Let’s go.” 0\nLi Guanqi covered her eyes with one hand while using his other hand to guide her out of town.0\nNot long after they left, Zhao Yuanlin arrived with a large group of twenty-plus men with horses. His expression turned terrifyingly dark at the sight of the six corpses on the ground. Obviously, Li Guanqi had not let the old woman live either… 2\nZhao Yuanlin muttered coldly, “You think you can run after killing my men? Hmph! After him!” 0\nOn his command, they whipped their horses onward and galloped in the direction Li Guanqi had taken.0\nAt this point, Li Guanqi had only just left town and finally released Meng Wanshu’s hand. 0\nUnable to control her emotions any longer, she fell into his arms and bawled. “Sob! I thought… I thought… I thought I was going to… Sob… Why… why are you here…? Thank goodness you came… Guanqi, I was so afraid…” 0\nLi Guanqi gently held her in his arms and patted her back. His gentle voice and the warmth of his hands made her relax. “There’s no need to be afraid anymore. I’m here. Don’t cry; we’ve got to hurry. The last guy used a flare signal, so they will catch up to us very soon.” 0\nMeng Wanshu nodded with reddened eyes. However, her injuries and trauma left her weak in the knees. 0\nLi Guanqi squatted and offered his back to her without hesitation. “Come, let me carry you on my back.” 0\nMeng Wanshu blushed, nodded slightly, and climbed on his back. 0\nThe contact between the both of them made Li Guanqi’s breath stop for a moment. Her cheeks heated up, and she buried her face in his shoulder shyly. 2\nThen, he sensed a massive vibration in the ground. His expression changed instantly, and he sprinted off like a madman. 0\nSimultaneously, he frantically scanned his surroundings with his heart’s eye, only to fall into despair.0\nThere were only flat grasslands in the ten-plus li radius around Changxing Town. There was nowhere for them to hide. 0\nVery soon, Zhao Yuanlin and his gang caught up to them. 0\nWhen they were almost a hundred zhang away, Li Guanqi stopped suddenly. It was impossible to outrun horses on flat land while carrying a person on his back. 0\nGently lowering Meng Wanshu to the ground, Li Guanqi whispered, “Stand with your back facing me and start counting. I’ll be back by the time you reach five hundred.” 1\nThen, he turned and looked at the men far away. Blood surged through his veins as his heartbeat rose to its limit. 0\nThe ice-cold killing intent radiating from him made Meng Wanshu turn her head slightly. Looking at his back, she felt like he was a stranger…0\nLi Guanqi clenched his teeth and closed his eyes, enduring the pain. This time, his killing intent was much stronger than before. 0\nThe young man sitting on the horse was the same young master from the Zhao Mansion eight years ago… He was Zhao Yuanlin—the monster who had treated his sister’s life as if it was worth nothing.0\nZhao Yuanlin had yet to catch a clear glimpse of Li Guanqi, but he soon approached close enough to see him. The moment he saw his face and white eyes, Zhao Yuanlin instantly recognized him! 0\nZhao Yuanlin had attained the Body Tempering Realm, just like Li Guanqi. 0\nHe leaped off his horse, his eyes gleaming with a strange excitement. “You’re that blind boy! Hahahaha! You’re not dead yet?! I thought that blizzard from eight years ago would have killed you already!”0\nZhao Yuanlin eyed Li Guanqi up and down, then he burst into laughter. “You’re just like your sister—you two have terrible fates. It looks like you’re a beggar now?” 0\nLi Guanqi glared at him. He counted the number of men, muttering to himself, “Seventeen, eighteen…” 0\nSensing the killing intent radiating from Li Guanqi, the horses surrounding him stomped nervously.. The riders whipped their horses, but none of them could keep their horses under control. 0\nMeng Wanshu closed her ears. With her back towards Li Guanqi, she squatted on the ground. “Seven… eight… nine…” 0\nZhao Yuanlin stood opposite Li Guanqi and leered at Meng Wanshu’s figure, feeling himself warm up at the tempting sight. He licked his lips and looked at Li Guanqi. “How are you two related?” 0\nLi Guanqi replied calmly, “She’s my future wife.” 0\nThen, he shot out at Zhao Yuanlin, who had let his guard completely down. A deep crater formed beneath his foot at the spot he launched from. Startled, Zhao Yuanlin tugged the reins next to him to shield himself with his horse. 0\nLi Guanqi’s fist landed on the horse’s head. The stallion, which weighed more than a thousand jin, was thrown into the air by his punch. Flesh and blood mixed as its skull shattered. 0\nAlthough he was standing behind the horse, the powerful force also forced Zhao Yuanlin dozens of steps backward. The guards around him were so shocked that they did not react. 0\nThe power Li Guanqi displayed… surpassed that of a normal human being.0\nLi Guanqi’s punch had been packed with rage, containing over five hundred jins of force. Finally, there was an outlet for the fury in his heart.0\nHe looked sideways at Zhao Yuanlin. “I may be poor, but I do have ten strings of coppers. Therefore, I shall also use ten strings of coppers to… buy your life!” 0\nZhao Yuanlin panicked. He could not believe that he could not compare to Li Guanqi despite also being a cultivator at the Body Tempering Realm… 0\nBut his ego and pride would not permit him to leave! This was a lowly beggar worth nothing—how could Zhao Yunlin ever see Li Guanqi as an equal?0\nZhao Yuanlin took a sword tied to another guard’s horse and roared, “Kill him!! A hundred taels of gold for anyone who kills him!” 0\nThe guards’ eyes shone when they heard the bounty. They leaped from their horses and swarmed at Li Guanqi. 0\nHowever… how could these brutes who only knew how to punch and kick ever be a match for him? 0\nWith each move, Li Quanqi crippled an opponent. Some, he killed outright, unable to control his strength.0\nAfter snapping a man’s neck with a punch, Li Guanqi strode closer toward Zhao Yuanlin. He was like the God of Death—no one could stop him. He had defeated all the guards in a mere ten breaths’ time, leaving half of them dead.0\nThe ones who remained alive screamed with pain as they collapsed on the ground. Broken limbs were considered light injuries when compared to the fatalities. 0\nZhao Yuanlin gritted his teeth, refusing to believe that he could not defeat Li Guanqi. With a sword in hand, he attacked! 0\nLi Guanqi had been fighting with only his fists so far, so facing a sword-wielding opponent was initially difficult. 0\nHowever, his punches were both quick and heavy. He found his chance between his dodges. As Zhao Yuanlin retracted his sword, Li Guanqi struck him in the chest.0\nCrack! 0\nThe single punch had broken four of Zhao Yuanlin’s ribs. He crashed to the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood. There was a slight change in his gaze as he spotted Meng Wanshu out of his peripheral vision. He took out a piece of talisman paper and stuck it on himself. At the next moment, the talisman self-ignited. 0\nLi Guanqi’s heart skipped a beat when Zhao Yuanlin shot off toward Meng Wanshu like a gust of wind. His expression fell, and he made a sharp turn, going after Zhao Yuanlin.0\nLi Guanqi loosened his sleeve, and a dagger fell into his hand. He threw the dagger with all his might.0\nPfft! 0\nThe dagger plunged into Zhao Yuanlin’s shoulder, making him slow down. 0\nTaking advantage of the slowdown, Li Guanqi finally arrived behind Meng Wanshu. 0\nWhoosh! 0\nThe blade of Zhao Yuanlin’s sword pierced through Li Guanqi’s right shoulder. 0\nZhao Yuanlin’s eyes lit up with excitement, but when he tried to pull the sword out, he realized Li Guanqi was gripping the blade tightly with his right hand. Li Guanqi’s blood trickled slowly down the blade as he glared at Zhao Yuanlin.0\nZhao Yuanlin’s gaze locked with Li Guanqi’s bloodshot white eyes, sending a chill down his spine. He had no choice but to squeeze and shatter the jade slip in his hand. 4\n“Ten strings of coppers!” Li Guanqi said coldly. He clenched his left fist as a terrifying aura slowly gathered in it. 0\nBam! 0\nThe blow sent Zhao Yuanlin flying. His chest had caved in, causing him to spit out blood mixed with pieces of his flesh.0\nLi Guanqi’s face paled as he grasped the sword impaling his shoulder and slowly pulled it out. Then, with the bloodstained sword in hand, he strode toward Zhao Yuanlin.0\nMeng Wanshu was still counting. “Eighty-five…” 0\nZhao Yuanlin watched with terror as Li Guanqi closed in on him. Gripped with fear, he instinctively scrambled backward. “You can’t kill me! You can’t! I’m going to test my spirit root soon… I’m going to become an immortal! Don’t kill me… If you spare me, I’ll give you so much money! And spirit stones! Yes! I’ll give you spirit stones!” 0\nLi Guanqi took some coppers from his pocket and tossed them on the ground.0\n“Your lowly life is only worth ten strings of coppers,” he muttered icily.2"

    "content": "Whoosh!0\nA golden ray of light shot out from Changxing Town, piercing the clouds.0\nLi Guanqi looked up sharply and saw someone in white robes walking on air with a sword hanging by his waist. His face paled. “If this person can fly and has a sword… He must be a Foundation Building Realm cultivator!”0\nWhen Zhao Yuanlin saw the cultivator, he hurriedly took out two more paper talismans and pasted them on his body. They transformed into a golden protective screen that covered him. 0\nHe finally relaxed and lay down on the ground, laughing hysterically. “Hahahaha! You idiot! You idiot! You can’t kill me! I’m going to skin you alive when we meet again!”0\nLi Guanqi took a deep breath. After weighing his options, he decided to leave. While he was sure he could figure out a way to break the protective shield, it would take a lot of time. Since he had not cultivated qi yet, facing a Foundation Building Realm cultivator meant certain death.0\nLi Guanqi collected the coppers and then hoisted Meng Wanshu up from the waist, causing her to cry out in surprise. With Meng Wanshu in his arms, Li Guanqi leaped on a horse, and then sped off toward their village.0\nWhen the white-robed cultivator saw Zhao Yuanlin’s injuries, his face paled.0\nFinally seeing hope, Zhao Yuanlin shouted, “Master Zhao… h-help me out first… We’ll… we’ll catch that bastard later.”0\nThe short man scooped Zhao Yuanlin into his arms and left.0\nAs for the other guards—well, whether they lived or died, they had nothing to do with him.0\nLi Guanqi and Meng Wanshu sped off across the plains on the horse. As Meng Wanshu leaned against Li Guanqi’s broad chest, she felt a strange sense of security. It was her first time on horseback, yet she felt oddly at ease in his arms.0\nShe looked up and secretly shot him a few glances. Why didn’t I notice his good looks before…?1\nAs Meng Wanshu swooned, Li Guanqi clenched his teeth with a torn look. He knew that he was given a very rare opportunity today, but… with Meng Wanshu there, he could not take the risk.0\nHe sighed. As his mind returned to the present, he noticed that Meng Wanshu was becoming groggy and turning pale. That was when it hit him—her wrist was still bleeding.0\nThe sky had turned dark, so it was impossible to ascend the mountain tonight.0\nHaving no choice, he brought her to his secret cave to spend the night.0\n***0\nCrackle!0\nThe crackling of firewood echoed in the small cave. 0\nLi Guanqi occasionally visited this place to find peace—it was a space that truly belonged to him. However, it was sparsely furnished, as he didn’t even have a spare blanket at home, let alone other supplies.0\nOutside, the rain grew heavier, swelling from a drizzle into a storm.0\nInside, Meng Wanshu lay on the ground, covered with a grass mat. Li Guanqi sat by the fire, feeling a little more relaxed because the Foundation Building Realm cultivator had not come searching for them. 0\nHe spaced out while staring at the fire, shadows dancing on his face as the fire flickered in the dark. He wanted to kill Zhao Yuanlin as soon as possible, but his desire to keep the girl away from harm was stronger.0\nIf I get another chance… I must kill him!0\nWhile his thoughts ran wild, he suddenly heard a moan behind him.0\n“Mmmm…”0\nLi Guanqi quickly got up and rushed to Meng Wanshu’s side. He asked gently, “Awake already?”0\nMeng Wanshu looked at her bandaged wrist and blushed. The swelling in her cheek had subsided significantly, but some redness still remained.0\nAs the night wind blew into the cave, Meng Wanshu shivered beside Li Guanqi. He found the way she was hugging herself quite amusing.0\nCold and hungry, Meng Wanshu pursed her lips and cursed quietly, “Those lechers! If it weren’t for them, I would have arrived home a long time ago!”0\nLi Guanqi smiled. “So, do you finally know the difference between real and fake lechers?”0\nMeng Wanshu blushed and rolled her eyes. Today, Li Guanqi made her feel something she had never experienced before.0\n“She’s my future wife.” His words still echoed in her mind.0\nHer cheeks heated up. She ducked her head, burying her face between her knees. 0\nSeeing how cold she was, Li Guanqi took out the jars of wine he’d bought. Passing one to her, he said gently, “Drink a little. It’ll warm you up.”2\nWhen she took the jar, she could not help but ask, “You’re not trying to get me drunk to… do anything, are you?”0\nLi Guanqi coughed awkwardly. “Cough, cough… Why would you think that… You’ll fall sick easily in this cold weather. I’m stronger and can stand it because I practice martial arts, but you should drink some.”0\nShe replied stubbornly, “Then… then you drink too.”0\nExasperated, Li Guanqi had no choice but to drink as well. Neither of them was used to alcohol, so they both coughed as they drank.0\nAfter a short while, their faces had turned red from the wine. And under the influence of the alcohol, they both inched closer together…0\nThen, somehow, their lips met. The warm aura of a budding love started to fill the entire cave.0\n“Mmm…”2\n***0\nAtop the mountain, Li Guilan and Meng Jiangchu were going mad with worry over their daughter, Meng Wanshu. 0\nIn contrast, Su Xuan smiled as he smoked and drank wine. He had just returned from the mountains.“That’s enough, Old Meng. Everything will be fine. The rain just delayed the kids. They’ll return tomorrow morning.”0\nBut the panicking Meng Jiangchu threatened coldly, “If that brat dares do anything, I’ll slaughter him! And also, why are you stopping me from getting revenge? Killing a mere Foundation Building cultivator is easier than squashing an ant!”4\nSu Xuan smiled. He had not expected Meng Jiangchu to contact him first via voice transmission. It seemed like he was genuinely panicking.0\nSu Xuan tapped his pipe and said gently, “I’ll go play chess with Old Lu. Come see me later.”0\n***0\nOn the eastern side of Prosperity Village, there was a locust tree several centuries old. Su Xuan stood under the tree, wearing long, gray robes. He carried a stool in one hand as he walked over.0\nDespite the heavy rain, not a single drop of water fell on him.0\nA kind-looking old man was sitting beneath the tree, playing Go [1] alone.0\nWhen he saw Su Xuan, he greeted him like an old friend.0\n“Tsk tsk, have you eaten?”0\nSu Xuan did not answer that question. Instead, he said with a relaxed expression, “Old Lu, today shall be our final game together.”0\nThen, he picked up a white piece and placed it on the board. Su Xuan looked up and commented softly, “Old Meng and Old Zhang from west of the village… I know who they are… But you… I have meditated on it for eight years, and I still cannot figure you out.0\n“You… What is your name?”0\nThe old man gave a small smile and placed a black chess piece next to the white.0\n“Me? I’m just a lonely old man. As for my name… Lu Tiancheng.”0\nSu Xuan furrowed his brow and muttered softly to himself, “Lu Tiancheng… Never heard of it. Probably no one important.”0\nIt was a brazen thing to say. But at this moment, Su Xuan was a different man entirely, a far cry from the freeloading old man who ate other people’s food.0\nCrack!0\nSu Xuan suddenly squashed the black chess piece with his knife’s scabbard. He said calmly, “I don’t care who you are, and I don’t care how awe-inspiring your name is. As long as I am here, you shall not touch my grandson! You couldn’t even if you tried!”0\nWhoosh!0\nThen, the shattered crumbs of the chess piece regrouped and it returned to its original form. The old man did not look like he had heard Su Xuan’s threat.0\nHe replied softly, “Whether I can or not… I’ll only know if I try, right?”0\nSu Xuan gave a small smile and scratched his head with the scabbard. He rose to his feet and said, “Do it now, then. I’m afraid I’ll be busy tomorrow. “0\nThe old men disappeared into thin air.0\nSoon after, two people from the village walked up to the chess board under the locust tree. 0\nThe first was Zhang Qixuan, a thin and withered old man smoking a pipe. He looked at the person behind him and blurted, “Old Meng, I’m telling you to look at this chessboard!”0\nMeng Wanshu’s father, Meng Jiangchu, approached the chessboard. As he scanned it with his eyes, his expression grew solemn. “It looks like Old Su intends to show his hand today…”0\nThey fell silent, not knowing what to say.0\nSuddenly, the space in front of them twisted.0\nSu Xuan slowly walked out of the spatial crack. His clothes were slightly damaged, but he maintained a nonchalant expression.0\nMeng Jiangchu’s eyes narrowed. As he studied the pitch-black knife scabbard, his eyes glinted. “Where’s that old man surnamed Lu?”0\nSu Xuan pointed at the chessboard and said, “Have you both seen this?”0\nMeng Jiangchu nodded. The hunchbacked Zhang Qixuan tapped his pipe and smiled. “So what if we have? So what if we haven’t?”0\nSu Xuan did not reply. He placed the scabbard on his hip and the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth surrounding him started to sizzle. He closed his fist and a red-gold knife hilt started to materialize.0\nZhang Qixuan found that he could not move at all, as if there was an invisible force keeping him tied to one spot. Cold sweat trickled down his forehead.0\nSu Xuan slowly gripped the sword hilt as a terrifying energy shot up from him into the clouds. Within a ten-thousand zhang radius around him, the wind howled and lightning crackled.2\n“You bunch of ancient bastards are incredibly annoying… Why won’t you listen when I speak to you calmly? Must I personally come to the Black Sect Territory to make you listen? Haven’t I been kind enough to let you keep your Transformation Realm body?”0\nZhang Qixuan fell to his knees and kowtowed, his Adam’s apple trembling. His eyes filled with horror as he gulped. 0\nSu Xuan pressed Zhang Qixuan’s head down on the ground, but he did not have the slightest intention of fighting back. “Please spare me my life, sir! I will leave the Daxia Territory immediately!”0\nThe knife made of spirit light slowly disappeared, and Su Xuan smiled. “Now that’s what I want to hear… I am a reasonable man who prefers to use my intellect to make people submit. I despise fighting physically.”2\nMeng Jiangchu, standing nearby, asked, “What happened to Lu Tiancheng?”0\nThe old man shrugged and hung the scabbard on his hips again as he muttered, “I killed him. I had no choice; he wouldn’t reason with me.”0\nMeng Jiangchu’s breath caught when he heard the response.0\nSu Xuan turned to look at him and said softly, “You… spent huge effort and energy to predict the future. Then, you came here fifteen years in advance just to wait for me. So, what is your choice?”0\nMeng Jiangchu’s heart skipped a beat. He still couldn’t discern Su Xuan’s true identity. He sighed and replied softly, “I give up. I still have Wanshu here, after all. And I quite like that boy Guanqi, so I will not interfere. But I have a question… What the hell is that thing?”0\nSu Xuan gazed silently at Meng Jiangchu for a long time, offering no response.0\nThere was slight confusion in Meng Jiangchu’s eyes, but in the end, he sighed and placed both hands behind his back. “Alright, then I will not fight anymore. Tomorrow, our family shall leave this place.”0\nSu Xuan nodded. He could not help but tease, “You’re not afraid that my grandson will kidnap your daughter, are you?”0\nMeng Jiangchu’s mouth twitched. Neither agreeing nor disagreeing, he said, “It is unlikely they will meet again in the future anyway. I’m done with this. I admit defeat.”0\nAfter Meng Jiangchu and Zhang Qixuan left, Su Xuan sat under the tree alone and picked up two black chess pieces. He waved, and the skies returned to their original state as if nothing had happened.0\nHe rested his hands on his back and muttered, “I managed to subjugate them using intellect! Indeed, they are both territorial lords who have cultivated for a long time, so they are wise enough to submit.”0\nSu Xuan then crossed his arms. “Have I left anyone out? Tsk, tsk. Zhang Qixuan and Meng Jiangchu, the territorial lords of the Black Sect and the Divine Treasure, were certainly wise to quit…”0\nThen, he looked up at the skies, making calculations with his fingers. He muttered, “The time has come… That brat will have to walk the rest of his journey alone.”0\n***0\nThe next morning, Li Guanqi and Meng Wanshu returned home, walking three chi[2] apart.0\nLi Guilan, as always, nagged when she saw her daughter, but her heart ached when she saw the wound on her daughter’s wrist. As for the lost groceries, those were hardly worth mentioning.0\nMeng Jiangchu drank the wine Li Guanqi brought back, but the more he drank, the more suspicious he felt.1\nCrash.0\nLi Guilan slapped Meng Jiangchu’s back. “You don’t need to drink it if you don’t want to! Why did you spill it?!”0\nSitting on the doorframe, Meng Jiangchu huffed and said, “Hmph! This wine tastes terrible!”0\nMeng Wanshu’s face turned red, not daring to speak. Last night, we almost…1\nMeanwhile, Li Guanqi went home and confessed to his grandfather. “Grandfather, I… killed someone when I descended the mountain.”0\nSu Xuan did not expect Li Guanqi to be so honest, but he merely nodded because he already knew everything. 0\n“Good. If you need to punch, you punch. If you need to kill, you kill. But… remember my teachings. You must never kill without a good reason. You must be able to convince yourself it was justified. If you massacre the innocent, I will make you a cripple! Do you hear me?!”1\nWhen Li Guanqi heard Su Xuan’s stern warning, he nodded solemnly.0\nSu Xuan looked at him, then said gently, “Come, let’s go to the backyard!”0\nThe journey of cultivation was long. Li Guanqi would need to walk the path on his own; Su Xuan could not shelter Li Guanqi his whole life.0\nAnd if he did, how could Li Guanqi be worthy of calling himself Su Xuan’s grandson?0\n1.

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 8 - Painting On Immortal Patterns Before Descending The Mountain",
    "content": "When Su Xuan and Li Guanqi arrived in the backyard, Su Xuan picked up a brush and sat behind a table. Li Guanqi instinctively took off his top and sat with his back facing Su Xuan. 0\nSu Xuan said softly, “This will be our last time. Bear with me.” 0\nLi Guanqi grinned. “Just do it, Grandfather. It’s not my first time doing this, anyway. I can take it.” 0\nWith a smile and paternal affection, Su Xuan lightly slapped Li Guanqi’s head. “You brat.” 0\nUsing the brush, he started to paint mysterious patterns on Li Guanqi’s back. Li Guanqi stayed as still as a boulder while the tip of the brush slid across his back. However, cold sweat sprouted from his forehead, and he occasionally let out a deep groan. 0\nLi Guanqi endured the inhuman agony mostly in silence, though sometimes he could not help but groan in pain. If the medicinal bath was like needles piercing into his body, this was like having his flesh cut out from his bones. The sharp pain was a hundred times worse than the medicinal bath.0\nTwo hours later, Su Xuan finally retracted the brush from Li Guanqi’s back. The patterns were finally connected, glowing with a strange blood-red light beneath the moonlight. 0\nSeeing this, Su Xuan broke into a smile of relief and blurted, “It’s finally done! You brat, weren’t you afraid I was going to hurt you? You trusted me that much?”0\nLi Guanqi remained silent for quite a while, recovering from the agony he had endured. Then, he turned and grinned at Su Xuan. “Grandfather, if you wanted to hurt me, you would not have gone into the mountains to gather spiritual herbs for me all these years. You would have just left me to freeze in that street eight years ago...”1\nAs Li Guanqi put his clothes back on, he hung his head and said, “Grandfather…”0\n“Mm? What is it?”0\n“Are you getting ready to leave?”0\nSu Xuan didn’t answer. 0\n“Will we meet again?”0\nPacking up the things on the table, Su Xuan replied wistfully, “That depends on whether you can cultivate fast enough…” Su Xuan’s eyes reddened, and he looked up. Then, he turned around, and with a wave of his hand, an object taller than Li Guanqi appeared. 0\nLooking at the teenager who had been calling him “Grandfather” for the past eight years, Su Xuan patiently advised, “The journey of cultivation is long. Always be wary of those who treat you overly well for no apparent reason!”1\nHe continued, “Some ancient monsters have been cultivating for thousands of years but cannot progress further. Desperate for a breakthrough, they will pull all sorts of evil tricks just to catch you!”0\nAlthough Li Guanqi had heard this advice countless times, he nodded solemnly. 0\nSu Xuan said, “I am leaving because I have no choice. It will be very dangerous, so I cannot take you with me. Tomorrow, you may descend the mountain.” 0\nHe glanced at the object and continued, “This sword coffin will be the most important gift I’ll give you. This sword coffin shall not leave your side, ever. Guard it well!” 0\nLi Guanqi peered curiously at the sword coffin, which was made of pitch-black stone with countless mysterious patterns carved on it. 0\nHe knew what a sword box was, but what was a sword coffin? 0\nIt was about four chi tall, a whole head taller than him. Su Xuan did not tell him anything about the coffin; he only instructed him to carry it on his back. 0\nLi Guanqi tried to carry it. It was precisely five hundred jin[1]! His eyes reddened from the strain of lifting it, and he finally understood that his grandfather’s previous teachings were all for this moment.0\nFrom this day onward, a swordsman with a sword coffin on his back was born. 2\n***0\nThe next morning, Li Guanqi stared at the dishes on the table, dumbfounded. 0\n“Grandfather… I can see you’ve prepared six dishes, but couldn’t you have made at least one of them a warm dish?” 0\nEverything on the table was a cold dish. 0\nSu Xuan gave a slight smile. He waved, and two beautiful jade wine cups appeared on the table. 0\nLi Guanqi took a sip, smiled, and asked, “Grandfather, does this mean you’re letting me drink wine?” 0\nSu Xuan smiled and replied softly, “You’re going down the mountain tomorrow. How will you survive if you don’t know how to drink?” 0\nLi Guanqi grinned and downed the cup of wine. The pungent wine burned his throat so much that he scrambled for water. It felt like a line of fire flowing down his throat.0\nSu Xuan burst into laughter and said hurriedly, “Slow down, brat. Don’t drink so fast. This is a good wine that will make you a man.” 0\n“Cough cough… Cough… I didn’t think it would be so spicy!” 0\nAfter a long time, Li Guanqi finally regained his breath. He quickly picked up two mouthfuls of food before asking, “Grandfather, what should I do after I go down the mountain?” 0\nSu Xuan rapped Li Guanqi’s head with his chopsticks and chuckled. “You have already reached the peak of the Body Tempering Realm. The next step is to guide the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth into your body to reach the Qi Refining Realm. When that happens, your heart’s eye will function just like a normal pair of eyes.” 1\nLi Guanqi’s white eyes darted around as he grinned excitedly. 0\nSu Xuan continued, “You’re already fourteen years old. That’s the age at which you should enter a sect. It is time for you to go down the mountain.” 2\nLi Guanqi had always dreamed of cultivating. From a young age, he dreamed of being an immortal who could fly through the skies on a sword. However, he also lived a very happy life with Su Xuan during the past eight years. He didn’t think they’d split up so quickly. 0\nLi Guanqi picked some vegetables up with his chopsticks and asked in a low voice, “There are countless sects in this world. Putting the Daxia Territory aside, the Azure Cloud Continent has countless powerful sects. Which one should I join?”0\nHe thought Su Xuan would think about it for a while. 0\nYet, to his surprise, Su Xuan blurted, “The Daxia Sword Sect!” 0\nLi Guanqi frowned. After living with Su Xuan for so long, he’d learned many secrets of the cultivation world. However, he had never heard Su Xuan mention the Daxia Sword Sect before.0\nSu Xuan saw through Li Guanqi’s confusion and said, “No, you have not heard of them before. Although it’s not a major faction, it is a sect with upright values and culture!” 0\nThey happily chatted away in the backyard while enjoying their wine. 0\nHowever, Li Guanqi’s alcohol tolerance was too low, so he collapsed after just two cups. He even muttered, “What’s so good about… this damn thing…”0\nSu Xuan smiled as he gazed at Li Guanqi, who had fallen asleep. “Young man, you’ll come to appreciate wine when you’re older.” 0\nHe took off his outer robe and draped it over Li Guanqi. Then, he waved and shot three rays of spirit light into the black sword coffin. 1\nAfter taking a long look at it, he turned and left. In a single step, he teleported through space, compressing millions of zhang into mere inches beneath him.0\n***0\nLi Guanqi groggily stirred from his slumber, unsurprised to find Su Xuan gone.0\nLooking at the map Su Xuan left on the table, tears flowed from his eyes. He picked up the map and said bitterly, “Grandfather… you could have left me some money!” 1\nLeft with no other choice, he packed up all the edible food in the house. He carried the gigantic sword coffin on his back and a large bundle of personal belongings in his arms. 0\nCreak~0\nLi Guanqi closed the main door carefully, hesitating there in silence for quite a while. Then, he left to go down the mountain. He initially wanted to visit the girl in Auntie Li’s house, but he found the Meng family home’s door tightly shut and did not even attempt to knock. 0\nHe scratched his head and lamented, “Damn it. They didn’t tell me.”0\nAlong the way, Li Guanqi passed through multiple villages and towns, where he heard many rumors about the Daxia Sword Sect. Most people talked about how good the sect was, as the thousand-li radius around it was managed so well that there were rarely any disasters. 0\n“It looks like the Daxia Sword Sect is as good as Grandfather said. The sect does have upright values and culture.” 0\nThree days later, Li Guanqi arrived at the foot of the mountain that housed the Daxia Sword Sect. Countless groans and complaints could be heard among the crowd—they had to climb the sect’s infamous Heaven Stairs. 0\nThere were a total of three thousand three hundred and thirty-three steps.0\nAt the bottom, an administrator of the sect set up a sign that said: 0\nCandidates must ascend the Heaven Stairs on their own. Using any items for assistance is strictly forbidden! 0\nLi Guanqi wove through the noisy crowd like a fish. With a smile on his face, he began to ascend. 0\nHis ascent caught the eyes of many people. 0\nA youth in luxurious robes frowned. “Who’s that guy? He’s climbing so quickly, even with such a large coffin on his back! He’s strong!”0\nSome people thought it was a stunt to earn the crowd’s favor. They believed that Li Guanqi would become fatigued very soon.0\nDespite these negative opinions, Li Guanqi’s behavior also triggered a sense of competitiveness in many candidates.0\nBut… in just five minutes, Li Guanqi was already far ahead of them.0\nHe still did not know that he had officially begun the Daxia Sword Sect’s entry examination. He felt nothing but excitement at the prospect of entering the sect his grandfather had talked about so highly. 0\nMany eyes had been fixed on Li Guanqi from the moment he took his first step. He showed no signs of fatigue despite the large stone coffin on his back, and the black strip of cloth around his eyes was also intriguing.0\nThe administrator, who had been silent since the beginning, suddenly turned to look at the youth on the steps. He estimated the stone coffin to weigh at least two hundred jin[2], yet the youth’s breathing remained steady. Li Guanqi showed no signs of struggle. 0\nThe administrator’s eyes flashed as he muttered, “Such a fit physique… He’s as strong as a peak Body Tempering cultivator!” 0\nWhoosh! 0\nHearing something approaching, Li Guanqi frowned and leaped one chi sideways. 0\n“Eh?” 0\nLi Guanqi bowed to the administrator, who had appeared next to him. “Uh… Senior, may I ask what you were about to do?”0\nWhen the administrator saw the youth’s agility, his smile widened. 0\n“Child, do not be afraid. This is just a talisman for keeping time.” 0\nLi Guanqi scratched his head awkwardly upon hearing what had shot toward him earlier. 0\nThe administrator spun his finger, and the yellow talisman spun once around Li Guanqi before pasting itself on Li Guanqi’s chest. 0\nThe administrator smiled and said, “Go on. Time is of the essence. The earlier you get up there, the better.” 0\nLi Guanqi smiled and bowed to him again. “Thank you, Administrator. I shall go, then.” 0\nThe administrator opened his mouth to say something, but Li Guanqi took a deep breath, braced himself, and then shot up the steps like a panther.0\n“Hiss… Such a strong physique! I was just about to ask him to take that thing off his back.” 0\nLi Guanqi rushed forward, passing people in a blur. He looked down at the talisman on his chest, which was disappearing slowly. Based on its rate of disappearance, he calculated how much time he had. 0\n“I have four hours… I can’t even see the end of this staircase; there must be a few thousand steps. This is no simple feat.” 0\nHe turned around to glance at the foot of the mountain and lamented, “There are just too many people…” 0\nHe did a rough estimation and concluded that there were at least thirty to forty thousand people at the foot of the mountain. Almost ten thousand of them were girls and boys aged between twelve and fourteen. The remaining people were their relatives and servants.0\n“It looks like entering a sect isn’t as simple as I thought it would be… I heard that eighteen thousand people attempted to join the Daxia Sword Sect last year, but only about a hundred were successful.” 0\nWhile Li Guanqi was immersed in his thoughts, another thin youth kept pace with him. 0\n1. 250kg ☜0\n2. 100kg ☜0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 9 – Everyone Is Shocked; How Is He So Fast?",
    "content": "The other youth was traveling as fast as Li Guanqi. 0\nHe wore white robes with jade pendants hung around his waist. When he passed Li Guanqi, he even snickered mockingly.0\nLi Guanqi frowned. The other person did not look like he had reached the Body Tempering Realm, so how was he moving so quickly?0\nThen, he spotted the two Clear Wind Talismans beneath the youth’s feet.0\nLi Guanqi shook his head, regulating his breathing and the rhythm of his footsteps. He did not know how many steps there were, so he had to conserve his energy as best he could. 0\nAt the thousandth step, many people sat on the ten-zhang-wide staircase. Only a two-chi-wide pathway was left for other candidates to pass.0\nIf the people in front slowed down, the people at the back had no choice but to wait too. The young men and women resting on the steps watched every passerby with a mocking look, some of them not even hiding their smirks.0\nWord-of-mouth must have brought these people together, gradually forming a dense crowd. Only a narrow path remained, just wide enough for one person to pass at a time.0\nLi Guanqi smirked coldly when he saw the crowd. “These people are trying to break another person’s umbrella after getting soaked in the rain![1] Hmmph!”0\nLi Guanqi observed his surroundings with full alertness using his heart's eye. He saw hand railings on one side of the staircase and a thousand-zhang cliff on the other.0\nDespite the terrifying drop, Li Guanqi stepped off the ground with all his might, springing high into the air. When he was two zhang high up in the air, he stepped on another youth’s shoulder to leap even higher.1\nSuch a shocking move triggered a wave of gasps from the crowd.0\n“Wow! How is that person leaping that far up?”0\n“Has he gone mad? What is he doing? This is a cliff!”0\nStep! Step!0\nLi Guanqi bent his knees when he landed on the railing, then sprang upward again like a panther on the hunt.1\nAlthough the crowd cried out with surprise at his stunts, no one was brave enough to imitate him due to the steep drop on the other side of the staircase. If they stumbled and fell, their bones would break, and they knew better than to rely on the Daxia Sword Sect for help.0\nHowever, Li Guanqi was not the only one who showed such courage.0\nThe crowd had blocked hundreds of steps. If they tried to pass through normally, they would be left far behind.0\nThere were many youths from large clans in the crowd. These people had trained their bodies since they were young and reached the Body Tempering Realm.0\nSomeone used pure arm strength to climb up the wall on the side of the staircase, overtaking the crowd like an orangutan swinging on vines. There were also people forcefully stepping on others’ shoulders to make it through the crowd.0\nThe participants started to pull all sorts of tricks to sprint to the end of the staircase.0\n“Hoo… Haa…”0\nLi Guanqi had passed the two thousandth step, maintaining the same speed. The strips of cloth tying the sword coffin to his back had cut two deep, bloody lines on his shoulders. Sweat drenched his eyes.0\nFew people remained around him.0\nPanting heavily, he finally reached the final step. With that, the talisman on his chest stopped burning. 1\nLi Guanqi bent over, resting his hands on his knees to catch his breath. A muscular youth approached him and reached out to pat his shoulder, but Li Guanqi sensed him and dodged aside.0\nSurprised, the youth retracted his hand and gave Li Guanqi a thumbs-up. “Nice one! You’ve got such a strong physique, brother!”0\nLi Guanqi turned his head at the tanned youth and smiled. “That’s high praise, brother. You did well too.”0\nThe youth laughed and scratched his head. “I’ve been trying to catch up with you the whole time. I was drenched in cold sweat when you overtook the crowd by stepping on the railings! You’re brave! Let me introduce myself. My name is Lin Dong.”1\nLi Guanqi froze briefly when he saw Lin Dong hold out his hand. After a moment of hesitation, he shook his hand. “I’m Li Guanqi, and I’m blind.”2\nLin Dong froze, looked at the strip of cloth covering Li Guanqi’s eyes, then grinned. “My friends call me Dongzi; you can call me that too. Let’s go. The event will be ending soon.”0\nLi Guanqi had a good impression of Lin Dong, so they both went to the plaza together.0\nWhen they entered, Li Guanqi scanned his surroundings and found that the plaza was at least two thousand zhang in radius. Behind the plaza, there were more than one hundred steps, which led to an entrance built in a gap between two mountain peaks.0\nThere was a stone with the sect’s name carved in dramatic calligraphy. Dozens of streams of sword qi whirled around it, all in various colors.0\nLin Dong started to tell Li Guanqi about the different mountain peaks in the sect. Li Guanqi confusedly replied, “Are you that familiar with the Daxia Sword Sect?”0\nLin Dong awkwardly smiled and scratched his head. “I’ve been practicing martial arts at the foot of the mountain since I was five. Joining the Daxia Sword Sect has been my lifelong dream, so of course I know them well. I’ll die happy if I can reach the Foundation Building Realm. I’ll soar through the skies on my sword and fight evil!”0\nAs they chatted away, a fat young man in golden robes struggled to the top of the steps. Panting and red-faced, he collapsed, his clothes soaked with sweat. The talisman pasted on his chest was only the size of a fingernail.2\nThe fat young man carefully held the tiny talisman, feeling such relief that he was on the verge of tears.0\nAfter catching his breath, he rose to his feet with difficulty. He spotted Li Guanqi and Lin Dong, then walked up to them with a grin. 0\nHe greeted them cheerfully, saying, “Nice to meet you two. My name is Li Sheng’an. I secretly brought a few chicken drumsticks. Do you want to eat with me?”0\nInitially, Li Guanqi considered refusing because eating a stranger's food wouldn’t be polite. However, his stomach gave in to the delicious smell and started growling.0\nLi Sheng’an grinned with squinting eyes, then pushed the drumsticks he took out from his pocket into their hands. Li Guanqi realized that the food was still warm.0\n“I stored them in my pockets,” Li Sheng’an said. “Don’t worry, I wrapped them in wax paper, so they won’t stink of sweat or anything.”0\nLin Dong burst into laughter and started to eat graciously. “My name is Lin Dong. He’s Li Guanqi. Honestly… climbing the steps almost killed me. I am indeed starving.”0\nLi Sheng’an also complained, “Yeah… As far as I know, the people from last year’s batch didn’t have to climb these steps. They could pay someone a couple of taels of silver to carry them up.”0\nLi Guanqi smiled without replying. He did not believe the Daxia Sword Sect would enforce this rule without a good reason.0\nAs expected, when the three of them had just finished their chicken, two young disciples in white sect robes flew out of the sect entrance.0\nThey flew through the air on their swords, their hands clasped behind their backs and their blades horizontal beneath their feet, leaving the crowd below in awe.0\nMore than three thousand people stood in the plaza, all holding their breath and looking at the two sophisticated figures with shining eyes.0\nThey were a young man and a young woman. The man was handsome, with sword-shaped eyebrows, bright eyes, and a determined look. The woman was elegant and sophisticated, with skin as fair as pork belly fat. She had a round face, willow-shaped eyebrows, a tall nose, and slightly thin lips. They looked very cool.3\nImpressing Li Guanqi wasn’t easy, but even he felt a surge of emotion at the sight. He fantasized about flying across the world with a sword by his side too.0\nLi Sheng’an muttered, “My goodness! Eldest Senior Brother Zhou Zhi and Eldest Senior Sister Jiang Su from the Heavenly Metal Peak’s outer sect have personally come to welcome us!”0\nLi Guanqi’s ears perked up as he silently memorized their names and ranks. Based on his observation, Li Sheng’an did not look like he was from an ordinary family.0\nThe young man and woman landed gracefully. All eyes were on them.0\nAt this point, very few people remained on the staircase.0\nZhou Zhi scanned his surroundings with a blank expression. Then, he slammed a gigantic gong. “Time’s up! Anyone who did not make it up the steps may leave!”0\nHis voice traveled far with the help of spiritual power. Many people started to complain, but Zhou Zhi ignored them. He tossed out a jade slip, and the thousand-step staircase vanished.0\nA thousand-zhang cliff had replaced the previously solid steps.0\nThe plaza they were standing on remained floating mid-air. Then, the mysterious, glowing runes started to glow in the middle of the plaza. They aggregated into a transport array that glowed weakly.1\nJiang Su’s cold voice rang out across space. “If the talisman on your chest has completely burned up, please step forward.”0\nA wave of unease traveled through the crowd.0\nAn invisible force radiated from Jiang Su, and the crowd fell silent. Many people stepped forward, hanging their heads dejectedly.0\n“Those who did not reach the top within the set time, please step into the array.”0\nLi Guanqi burst into laughter at the sight of Li Sheng’an, who was carefully holding his fingernail-sized talisman. “You’re very lucky. You were almost eliminated.”0\nLi Sheng’an kept his eyes on the yellow talisman paper as he wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and said, “Only Heaven knows how much I suffered!”0\nLin Dong looked at the fat youth and said in puzzlement, “Brother, you don’t look like you lack money. Why didn’t you get yourself some talismans to help you?”0\nLi Sheng’an snickered. “It’s not that easy… Just wait and see.”0\nZhou Zhi slowly levitated into the air. Glaring at the crowd, he said, “If you have cheated, please step forward!”0\nMany people looked down and avoided his eyes.0\n“Hmmph!”0\nEveryone felt as if a boulder was pressing on their chests. Then, Zhou Zhi tossed out a few transparent crystal balls. Moving images of people using talismans on their way up appeared within them. There were even images of people who consumed special powders to boost their speed.0\nAll of these cheaters were disqualified.0\nA muscular youth stepped forward indignantly, looked at Zhou Zhi, and shouted, “I only consumed some Vitality Powder, which improves blood circulation! I’m already at the peak of the Body Tempering Realm; what right do you have to disqualify me?!”0\nZhou Zhi turned and looked at him. He narrowed his eyes and said calmly, “Are you asking me for an explanation?”0\nThe youth said stubbornly, “I am! Not only have I reached the peak of the Body Tempering Realm, but my father also hired someone to test my spirit root long ago. I have a Wood-Fire True Spirit Root! How could I be treated the same as these other useless idiots?!”0\nZhou Zhi smirked coldly and descended from the sky toward the youth. Zhou Zhi, who was a whole head taller than the youth, looked down at him. “Do you think you’re very talented just because you have a Wood-Fire True Spirit Root? Is that why you look down on other people?”0\nThe youth felt a huge force pressing on him, making his face turn red as he strained against it. He replied stubbornly, “That’s right! How could you disqualify me?”0\n Zhou Zhi turned to look around and said softly, “Does anyone else think the same?”0\nWhen no one else dared to speak up, Zhou Zhi laughed. “You guys aren’t as brave as he is! What is your name?”0\nThe youth looked up at Zhou Zhi. Having calmed down, he said, “Luo Hu!”0\nZhou Zhi flew backward and stood mid-air. He looked at the crowd and boomed, “The Daxia Sword Sect does not want cheaters. Anyone else can take him as their disciple if they want him! If there are no other questions, get out of my face!”0\nLuo Hu’s face darkened as the flames of rage rose within him. He felt like Zhou Zhi was targeting him.1\nCoincidentally, he spotted Li Guanqi’s trio and took out his anger on Li Guanqi. Pointing at Li Guanqi, Luo Hu roared, “The Daxia Sword Sect is even accepting a blind cripple! I wouldn’t want to join a declining sect like that!”1\nWhen Zhou Zhi heard him, his face darkened. Looking at the three thousand candidates who came to join the sect, he said in a low voice, “When the Daxia Sword Sect recruits a disciple, we look at three things: character, resilience, and talent! You feel like you should have been accepted, right? Show me your talisman!”0\nLuo Hu took out the talisman from his pocket and tossed it at Zhou Zhi. The crowd gasped when they saw he had a quarter left. Most people only had a tenth of their talismans when they reached the top.0\nLuo Hu gave Zhou Zhi a smug look, as if saying the Daxia Sword Sect had missed out by not accepting him.0\nHowever, Zhou Zhi approached Li Guanqi and said gently, “Can you show me your talisman?”0\nLi Guanqi rubbed his nose, surprised to be dragged into the drama. Then, he gave the remaining folded talisman to Zhou Zhi. 0\nLuo Hu said, “And I thought it was going to be something impressive! He’s almost the same as me—he only has a quarter remaining! It proves that he has decent talent, but so what if he does?”0\nBut then, to the crowd’s shock, Zhou Zhi unfolded the talisman.0\nThree-quarters!0\nOnly a quarter of his talisman had burned up, leaving a huge section behind. When folded, it had looked tiny. 0\nEven Zhou Zhi was surprised. He looked at Luo Hu coldly and said, “You thought you were good? How about now? That’s enough of your nonsense—get the hell out of here!” 2\n1. Chinese idiom. It’s about sabotaging other people after having experienced hardship. ☜0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 10 – Spirit Root Test, Zhao Yuanlin",
    "content": "Luo Hu glared furiously at Li Guanqi, then strode into the transport array. More than three thousand people had reached the top of the staircase, but now, only one thousand and eight hundred remained. They were all ushered towards a mountain called Heavenly Son Mountain for the next event, which was the spirit root test.0\nThe remaining candidates were excited to take the test. Now, Li Guanqi realized that the talisman’s size did not affect the results at all. Li Sheng’an only had a fingernail-sized talisman left but also passed the first examination.0\nThis test was not even a proper examination—its purpose was to test the candidates’ character. They had four hours, and even if they rested for thirty minutes along the way, they would still finish on time. As such, it was merely a test of mental fortitude.0\nAlong the way, many people discussed the recent incident. How could the sect reject a Wood-Fire True Spirit Root disciple so easily? It showed that the Daxia Sword Sect was indeed an extraordinary faction.0\nIf this were another sect, the various elders would surely be fighting over Luo Hu. They might even train him as an alchemist. The difference between a Mixed Spirit Root and a True Spirit Root was huge.0\nThis meant that he had a Generating [1] Spirit Root, which was only ranked below a Single Heavenly Spirit Root.4\nHowever, the Daxia Sword Sect’s recruitment criteria were different. Just as Zhou Zhi implied, this was not the kind of faction that only looked at a person’s spirit root and family background. 0\nThis was why many people born to normal, peasant families felt that the recruitment process was fair. It also resulted in the rejection of many talented candidates, which was uncommon for a sect.0\nZhou Zhi and Jiang Su stood shoulder to shoulder. Jiang Su whispered, “An incident like this happens every year, hehe.”0\nZhou Zhi maintained a determined look and replied in a low voice, “The Daxia Sword Sect is small but closely united. We achieve such quality by weeding out the bad ones from the beginning.”0\nAnother stone-faced teenager stole glances at Li Guanqi, who looked behind him but could not spot anything unusual.0\nLi Sheng’an smiled but then noticed Lu Guanqi’s frown. “Guanqi, what’s wrong?”0\nLi Guanqi relaxed his brows and smiled slightly. “Nothing. I just feel like someone is watching me.”0\nLi Sheng’an grabbed Li Guanqi’s sleeve and gasped, “Huh? You can see?”0\nLi Guanqi grinned and pointed at his eyes, “I can’t. I am completely blind.”0\nLi Sheng’an nodded half-heartedly. “I don’t know if a person with Triple Mixed Spirit Root like me can pass the spirit root test.”0\nLi Guanqi asked, “Why? Is it tough?”0\nStanding beside them, Lin Dong interjected, “Do you not know anything about this?”0\nLi Guanqi shrugged. He only heard his grandfather talk about it occasionally. However, he was childish back then and didn’t pay attention. Furthermore, Su Xuan never told him whether he had a spirit root. Whenever he asked, Su Xuan would merely smile and remain silent.0\nLi Guanqi did not know what the results of his spirit root test would be. However, the mysteries of his cultivation would soon be revealed.0\nWhen everyone arrived at Heavenly Son Mountain, the elders of various peaks were already waiting. There was a gigantic flag bearing the “夏” (xia) character, flanked by a sword on both sides. On this plaza of a thousand-zhang radius, there were eight spirit root testing daises with a transparent crystal ball on them.0\nLi Guanqi activated his heart’s eye. Surprisingly, there were many high-level immortal elders on the daises. He hadn't realized how important the sect's recruitment day was to them.0\nSensing Li Guanqi’s confusion, Li Sheng’an explained softly, “This isn’t the most dramatic it can get. In some sects, even the sect masters attend their recruitment day. The elders will fight over any candidates who show great potential in the test!” 0\nHe continued, “Some prodigies may even skip the outer sect and join the inner sect directly! Tsk tsk. Resources in the inner sect far surpass those of the outer sect.”0\nLi Guanqi noticed an old man with countless wrinkles on his face resting his eyes behind the gathered elders. He had a deep set of eyes, an eagle-like nose, and a short beard similar to a mountain goat’s goatee. The man’s neat gray robes gave him a serious air. 0\nJust one look from those eyes was enough for anyone to feel guilty. This was Qin Xian, the disciplinarian of the Daxia Sword Sect. He was at the mid-stage Nascent Soul Realm.0\nThe crowd of more than a thousand people was divided into eight queues. The ground shook slightly, and then a green, glowing array rose into the air. 0\nThe old man on the dais suddenly opened his eyes.0\nBoom!0\nThe old man retracted his aura and scanned the crowd below with a sharp glare. “I am the disciplinarian of the sect, Qin Xian! Let’s begin the spirit root test!”0\n***0\nThe subsequent test could be described as good for some but bad for others.0\nEven if someone wanted to become an errand boy in the outer sect, the minimum requirement was having a Triple Mixed Spirit Root.0\nMost sects wouldn’t even glance at cultivators of this caliber. Their cultivation progressed at a snail's pace compared to those with Double True Spirit Roots, and even after pouring precious resources into their training, there was no guarantee they’d ever break through to the Qi Refinement Realm.0\nTens of people had been tested so far. Other than a few Triple and Quadruple false spirit roots, some people did not even possess spirit roots.0\nA young boy in tattered linen clothing from Li Guanqi’s queue stepped forward to be tested. When he placed his palm on the crystal ball, a blinding golden and blue light burst from it.0\nThe disciple performing the test smiled and announced, “Li Niu, age thirteen! Metal-Water True Spirit Root! He may enter Heavenly Metal Peak or Heavenly Water Peak! From today onwards, he shall be a disciple of Daxia Sword Sect’s outer sect. While he is with the sect, his parents shall receive a hundred taels of gold and silver.”0\nFinally, a True Spirit Root had appeared! Metal and Water had Generating interactions, which made it even better. This teenager’s main spirit root was Metal.0\nOn the dais, a man in golden robes smiled at the Heavenly Water Peak’s elder and said, “Elder Lan, why don’t you let Heavenly Metal Peak have him? He’s not a female cultivator anyway, so why don’t you let us take the glory this time?”0\nThe female elder in ice-blue robes huffed and said, “Meng Linhai! You can have him for five hundred spirit stones.”0\nThe elder of Heavenly Metal Peak, Meng Linhai, laughed. He waved, and a pouch flew out. “Fine, fine. I will give you the five hundred spirit stones. He’s worth the investment, haha.”0\nThe other elders smiled too.0\nOne of them said softly, “I wonder how many Heavenly Spirit Roots we’ll get in this batch of disciples.”0\nSomeone else said, “That’s hard to know. Heavenly Spirit Roots are rare.”0\n“Just a few True Spirit Roots will be excellent enough. Heavenly Spirit Roots are just too rare.”0\nThen, the elder of Heavenly Wood Peak let out a sigh. “I wonder if I can get my kids a new Junior Brother this year. Why are Wood Spirit Roots so rare?”0\nThe complaint upset another elder who had been resting his eyes. His eyes sprang open as he pointed at the Heavenly Wood Peak elder’s nose and scolded, “Why are you complaining? Didn’t Heavenly Wood Peak get almost twenty disciples last year? Heavenly Lightning Peak hasn’t even gotten a new disciple in three years! Three years! Do you know how much I’ve suffered?!”0\nLi Guanqi wondered why the elders on the stage had begun arguing. Among them, a thin old man was especially emotional.0\nLi Niu burst into tears and squatted on the ground, sobbing. He had never thought that he would get to join a sect one day and have the chance to cultivate.0\nThen, a disciple in the sect’s uniform took him away. Li Guanqi noticed that the symbol on that disciple’s uniform differed from the symbols on the other outer sect disciples’ uniforms.0\nThe symbol on his chest was a mountain peak piercing through clouds, and his shoulder had golden embroidery. Li Guanqi guessed that he was from the Heavenly Metal Peak.3\nAs the test went on, more and more disciples were recruited.0\nSuddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd. A ray of blinding golden light had burst from one of the crystal balls. The eight peak elders, who were watching onstage, suddenly appeared in the sky above.0\n“Metal Heavenly Spirit Root!”0\nThe youth was unsurprised, seemingly having expected this situation. The Heavenly Metal Peak’s elder smiled so wide that many folds appeared on his wrinkled face. In a flash, he appeared next to the youth. “Hahaha! Nice one! It’s a Heavenly Spirit Root! What is your name?”0\nThe teenager had handsome and defined features, though his thin lips gave the impression that he was not easy to get along with. 0\nThe youth bowed at the man, then turned to look at Li Guanqi. With a hint of mockery in his tone, he said gently, “Elder, my name is… Zhao Yuanlin!”4\nLooking down, Li Guanqi jolted. The grin on Zhao Yuanlin’s face widened.0\nMeng Linhai smiled and said, “Good, good! From today onward, you shall join the Heavenly Metal Peak and officially become one of our inner sect disciples. I will also take you in as one of my core disciples. What do you think?”0\nMeng Linhai was a cultivator at the Golden Core Realm, so naturally, he was qualified to recruit core disciples. However, Zhao Yuanlin was arrogant and a mere Heavenly Metal peak elder was not enough to move him. His goal was to become the Heavenly Metal peak master’s direct disciple.0\nTherefore, Zhao Yuanlin merely gave a small smile and did not reply.0\nMeng Linhai returned his smile and did not take offense. Prodigies were usually more arrogant, so it was understandable. Whether or not the Heavenly Metal Peak Master wanted him was a separate matter.0\nWhen he saw that Zhao Yuanlin did not intend to leave immediately, Meng Linhai asked, “What’s the matter? Do you still want to watch?”0\nThere was a twinkle in Zhao Yuanlin’s eye as he replied loudly, “Of course. There’s another person from my hometown here. I want to watch.”0\nMeng Linhai did not dwell on the matter. It was common for friends to continue supporting each other after joining the sect, so he didn’t mind.0\n“Oh? Are you guys close?”0\nHowever, Zhao Yuanlin’s subsequent words were like a boulder falling into a still lake, causing waves of shock.0\n“No, no. I wouldn’t be close to a person who would exchange his sister’s life for ten strings of coppers. I’m just curious… would the Daxia Sword Sect want a person like this?”0\nAll the elders frowned in unison and glared fiercely. They did not want someone with a character like that, no matter how talented they were.0\nSuddenly, all the candidates who had not been tested yet fell silent.0\nLi Guanqi’s eyes flashed with ice-cold killing intent.1\n1. In the scheme of the Five Agents (Wuxing), the five agents—Fire, Water, Wood, Metal, and Earth—interact with each other. There are two types of interactions: Generating and Overcoming. Generating interactions result in positive outcomes, and it can be said that both agents complement and boost each other. Overcoming interactions cause both agents to diminish. Wood and Fire are said to have a Generating Interaction. Source: ☜0\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxing_(Chinese_philosophy) ☜0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 11 – Why Would I Keep Quiet",
    "content": "Li Guanqi trembled as he clenched his fists tightly. Li Sheng’an noticed Li Guanqi’s unusual agitation and knew something bad would happen, so he hurriedly said, “Don’t act rashly, Guanqi! Keep quiet, and it will pass.”0\nHe believed that with Li Guanqi’s capabilities, he could surely secure a place in the Daxia Sword Sect. Acting rashly would be unwise.0\nLi Guanqi’s eyes remained fixed on Zhao Yuanlin onstage, biting his lip so hard that it bled.0\nLi Sheng’an watched in alarm as Li Guanqi’s eyes became bloodshot.2\nBoom!0\n“Quiet?” The stone tile beneath Li Guanqi’s feet shattered into fragments as he roared, saying, “Why would I keep quiet?!”0\nLi Guanqi shot off like a gust of wind. The crowd watched as he leaped up the dais using the common Wooden Pole Step Technique. Then, he threw his fist at Zhao Yuanlin, who was still spewing venomous lies about him.0\nMeng Linhai’s eyes narrowed. He was about to reach out to stop Li Guanqi, but Second Elder Xu Zhengjie of Heavenly Lightning Peak stopped him. “It is not clear yet who is telling the truth. Why would you believe only one side? Plus… it’s not like the kid can’t take a punch.”0\nWhen Zhao Yuanlin saw Li Guanqi coming, the corner of his lips curled into a smirk. A faint ripple of energy radiated from his body as he retaliated with a punch of his own.0\nBoom! Their fists collided with a thunderous impact.0\nLi Guanqi felt his blood surge from the effort as he briefly leaned back, keeping his feet planted in the same spot.0\nOn the other hand, Zhao Yuanlin was sent reeling backward, stumbling seven steps back before regaining his balance. A trickle of blood escaped the corner of his mouth as his arm hung limply by his side. “You blind idiot! You deserve to die!”0\nZhao Yuanlin’s right arm was bent at a grotesque angle. White bone had pierced through his skin, with pieces of flesh hanging from it. Blood flowed from the wound.0\nThe severity of his injury shook the crowd.0\nMoments earlier, Xu Zhengjie had considered intervening to stop Zhao Yuanlin from retaliating. After all, Zhao Yuanlin was at the peak of the Body Tempering Realm and had already started absorbing spirit qi.0\nXu Zhengjie had never thought the blindfolded youth could defeat his opponent with pure physical strength.0\nThe disparity between them was staggering.0\nZhao Yuanlin’s face paled. He had not expected Li Guanqi to be so powerful.0\n“Li Guanqi! How dare you attack me in front of a group of elders?! Are you scared of me exposing your evil deeds to the world? You’re nothing but scum! You’re afraid! You’re afraid of me! Hahaha!”0\nAs Zhao Yuanlin hurled insults at him, he twisted the narrative, portraying Li Guanqi as a villain who had lashed out because his misdeeds had been exposed.0\nInsults and criticism filled the whole plaza.0\n“Hmmph! The guy must feel guilty; that’s why he attacked!”0\n“Exactly! If this guy can sell his family off for money, he has terrible character.”0\n“I agree! Didn’t Senior Brother mention that character evaluation is part of the recruitment process? I think this guy has a terrible character! I wouldn’t want to be in the same sect as him.”0\n“I don’t want someone like that to join the sect! The thought of being his fellow disciple is embarrassing!”0\nLi Guanqi endured the insults silently, reacting only by clenching his fists tightly. He clearly wanted to attack again.0\nXu Zhengjie frowned. He injected spirit power into his voice to shock the crowd. “Enough! Silence!”0\nThe plaza fell to an immediate hush. 0\nStanding in the crowd, Lin Dong clenched his teeth. He had been with Li Guanqi the whole way here, so they had become friendly. To him, Li Guanqi would never do such a thing. 0\nLi Sheng’an quickly pulled him back in fright, his voice dropping to an anxious whisper. “What are you doing?! Have you also lost your mind?! 0\n“Think about it—even if Guanqi is innocent, Zhao Yuanlin’s Heavenly Spirit Root guarantees him a place in the inner sect. He may even become some elder’s core disciple. Do you want to make an enemy of someone like that? Defending Guanqi now is just asking for trouble!”0\nLin Dong gazed at Li Sheng’an for a long moment, his voice quiet but unyielding. “If we all choose to remain silent and close our eyes to injustice, can we still call ourselves true cultivators?!”0\nThen, he shouted from the middle of the crowd, “I do not believe that he is that kind of person!”0\nThe crowd separated slowly, revealing the tanned Lin Dong. He glared at Zhao Yuanlin, who was lying on the ground.0\n“How dare you make such accusations! Where’s your proof? Anyone can spew baseless, life-ruining slander! I can even say you fancy men! What will you do about it?”0\nThe moment he said it, the crowd calmed down. Some people even laughed at Lin Dong’s remark. Li Guanqi had not expected Lin Dong to defend him in a moment like this. He raised his hand slightly to tell Lin Dong it was enough.0\nThen, Li Guanqi turned his head to “look” down at the one thousand candidates with a mocking smirk. Even blindfolded, he seemed to see every person in the crowd, making them feel guilty.0\nWithout a flicker of emotion, Li Guanqi gently remarked, “When a dog barks in the village, the rest of the dogs bark too. However, they do not know why they are barking. 0\n“The difference between humans and animals is that humans can think for themselves. But if a person isn’t even intelligent enough to distinguish between right and wrong… Hehe…”0\nLi Guanqi turned around and strode slowly toward Zhao Yuanlin. His footsteps were heavy and powerful, and the box on his back made him look extra menacing.0\n“What are you doing?!”0\nZhao Yuanlin’s pitch grew higher subconsciously. His eyes flashed with anger. This anger… came from his fragile ego and arrogance. 0\nHe couldn’t believe that someone who once survived on his leftovers had struck him down with a single blow. Zhao Yuanlin could not accept this reality. After all, he had a Heavenly Spirit Root!0\nWhen Xu Zhengjie looked at Li Guanqi, his eyes lit up. It wasn’t the strange sword box or his peak body tempering foundation that caught his attention—it was Li Guanqi’s words, which revealed a mind that dared to think for itself.0\nAs for his blindness… In Xu Zhengjie’s eyes, Li Guanqi could see better than anyone else.0\nLi Guanqi crouched down and slowly removed the strip of cloth around his eyes. Gasps echoed through the crowd as they noticed his pair of white eyes.0\nWhen Zhao Yuanlin looked at those eyes, he lost all hope.0\nLi Guanqi suppressed his anger as he boomed, “You’re right. I did take ten strings of coppers from Zhao Mansion! But do you dare tell the audience what this money was for?”0\nThere was a flash of panic in Zhao Yuanlin’s eyes. “Like I said, you sold her—”0\nThe crack of Li Guanqi's palm against Zhao Yuanlin’s cheek cut through the air. “Shut your mouth! That money was compensation for my sister’s life! She died after barely a month of service in your estate—worked and starved to death!0\n“Even when she died… When your people tossed her body out, you were all so cheap that you wouldn’t even spare a scrap of cloth to cover her! Zhao Qing, your gatekeeper, even tried to pocket those ten strings of coppers! Deny it if you dare!”0\nAt this point, Li Guanqi's eyes were bloodshot, and his voice trembled slightly with barely contained rage. His killing intent was palpable.0\nHis cheeks were puffed up from exertion, and a green vein pulsed from his forehead. His face was completely red.0\n“Yes, I’ve been a beggar since I was young. The Zhao Estate’s scraps were my lifeline. Ten strings of copper—that’s the price you put on a servant’s life. That’s all we're worth to you! Just ill-fated scum, destined to grovel at your feet! You think we’ll always be beggars, so you treat us like dirt!”0\nLi Guanqi turned to look at the crowd. “Can it be said that I received ten strings of coppers in exchange for my sister’s life? Yes and no. 0\n“Eight years ago, I was a six-year-old child. At the time, Zhao Qing tried to cheat me with four strings of copper. But I had only one thought—that the ten strings of coppers were my sister’s last shred of dignity! So I fought for what was owed! He had to pay!”0\nSlowly rising to his full height, Li Guanqi's contempt-filled gaze bore down on Zhao Yuanlin. “That was what the ten strings of copper were for!”0\nZhao Yuanlin’s face turned pale. He looked around and realized that everyone was looking at him differently now. Furious, he shouted, “So what? You’re just ill-fated scum! So what if you’re here to join the sect? I have a Heavenly Spirit Root! A Heavenly Spirit Root! And you? I don’t think you even have a spirit root!”0\nXu Zhengjie’s face had long turned green. With a swift kick, he sent Zhao Yuanlin dozens of zhang back into the air. Then, he opened his palm, and a black Thunder Whip several zhang long appeared in his hand with a loud crackling sound. 0\nHe raised his arm, about to whip Zhao Yuanlin.0\nMeng Linhai looked torn. He opened his mouth but hesitated when he saw Xu Zhengjie’s furious expression. “Old Xu… He…”0\nHowever, the furious Xu Zhengjie pointed at Meng Linhai’s nose and yelled, “Shut your mouth, Meng Linhai! Will you break the sect's rules over a mere Heavenly Spirit Root? If you stop me, I’ll whip you too!” 2"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 12 – Empty Spirit Root",
    "content": "Through his heart’s eye, Li Guanqi watched the events unfold with cold satisfaction. The elder’s punishment of Zhao Yuanlin seemed pointless to him, yet he made no move to intervene. As long as Zhao Yuanlin got beaten up, he was satisfied.0\nThe Thunder Whip tore into Zhao Yuanlin’s flesh, splitting his skin and scorching it black with rising smoke.0\n“Ah! Stop it! No… why?! What right do you have to hit me?! Ah!! Help! Don’t… don’t hit me.”0\nHis cries echoed across the space as Xu Zhengjie whipped him seven times.0\n“Zhao Yuanlin! A Heavenly Spirit Root means nothing when paired with such a vile character. The Daxia Sword Sect will never accept someone like you!”0\nZhao Yuanlin lay on the ground, his breathing shallow. His gaze remained fixed on Li Guanqi.0\nLi Guanqi had an idea and said, “In that case, dear Elders, why don’t you let me test my spirit root?”0\nHe stepped in front of the Spirit Root Testing Crystal. He turned to look at Zhao Yuanlin, who lay on the ground like a dying dog. “You want to see whether a beggar like me has a spirit root, don’t you? Well then, keep your eyes open… Don’t you dare blink!”0\nHe was doing this to completely shatter Zhao Yuanlin’s pitiful ego.1\nAs for calling himself a beggar… Li Guanqi did not even care about revealing this so-called “weakness.” If he showed a weakness on his own, it was no longer considered a weakness. In the world of cultivation, capability was number one.0\nMeng Linhai fell silent too. Heavenly Metal Peak had just lost a disciple with a Heavenly Spirit Root. However, his expression also darkened as he recalled the sect rules. Someone with such a rotten character has no place among us.0\nXu Zhengjie looked directly at Li Guanqi, his voice low but firm. “Alright! Test him! Even if you have a Triple Mixed Spirit Root, the Heavenly Lightning Peak will take you in!”1\nLi Guanqi smiled and walked up to the crystal ball under the watchful gazes of the crowd. He took a deep breath. Even Li Guanqi did not know what his spirit root was.0\nHe held the crystal ball in his palm, and the whole plaza fell silent.0\nThroughout the years, he’d always sensed that his grandfather, Su Xuan, was incredibly powerful. Su Xuan’s effort in gathering herbs for him suggested his spirit root must be decent, if nothing else. Also, based on the way those herbs glowed, he knew they must have been valuable.0\nZhao Yuanlin pursed his lips and stared at the transparent crystal ball.0\nEight-colored lights danced and flowed within the ball as it tested his spirit root. The final color and brightness would determine his spirit root and potential.0\nIn a few breaths’ time, the lights danced faster.0\nThere was a sudden cracking sound, and the crystal ball shattered.0\nEveryone in the plaza exchanged glances.0\nZhao Yuanlin pointed at Li Guanqi and laughed like a madman. “Hahaha! Trash! You’re trash! Even the Spirit Root Test Crystal broke! You’re not even fit to have a Triple Mixed Spirit Root! You’re nothing but ill-fated scum! Scum!”0\nHis insults sparked outrage in the crowd—many among them possessed Triple Mixed Spirit Roots themselves, and a lot of them would still earn recruitment into the sect based on the crystal ball’s readings.0\nMeng Linhai furrowed his brow. His impression of Zhao Yuanlin had reached rock bottom. He raised his hand and shot a golden light, sealing Zhao Yuanlin’s mouth. “Enough of this nonsense!”0\nLi Guanqi was also stunned by the incident. He scratched his head awkwardly. “Uh… I don’t know why this thing exploded on its own. I don’t need to pay for it, do I?”0\nThe elders seemed to recall something, exchanging meaningful glances. Each saw the same disbelief mirrored in the others’ eyes.0\nMeng Linhai froze when he saw their expressions. His Adam’s apple trembled. “Are you guys thinking what I’m thinking?!”0\nLan He, the female elder of Heavenly Water Peak, soared into the sky and commanded, “Quickly! Bring the Spirit Root Testing Stele!”0\nThe group of elders erupted into chaos. Everyone else was confused.0\nEldest Senior Brother Zhou Zhi from the outer sect muttered to himself, “Could he have a King Spirit Root, which is better than the Heavenly Spirit Root?”0\n“Could it be true?” Jiang Su whispered in astonishment. “The last time the King Spirit Root appeared was twelve years ago.”0\nZhou Zhi nodded slightly and replied, “That’s right. That was Wu Bing—now the Eldest Senior Brother and the sect master’s direct disciple. I heard he is currently in a closed-door cultivation retreat, attempting a breakthrough to reach the Golden Core Realm. If he succeeds within three years, he’ll achieve Golden Core cultivation at merely thirty years of age!”0\nThe elders looked at Li Guanqi differently now. Even the second elder of Heavenly Lightning Peak, Xu Zhengjie, had greed in his eyes.0\nShortly after, four inner sect disciples of the Foundation Building Realm arrived. They carried a black stone stele about one zhang long and ascended the dais.0\nThe black stele weighed thousands of jins and had many names carved on it. A closer look revealed that each name had King Spirit Root inscribed next to it—save for one.0\nAt the very top of the list stood a solitary name marked by an inscription so ancient that it had not appeared in ten thousand years.0\nLi Guanqi approached the stele nonchalantly, pressing his palms against two carved handprints in the stone.0\nA humming sound filled the air, the stone stele trembled, and eight-colored lights lit up everything within a radius of hundreds of zhang.0\nThen, the lights disappeared and left behind a white light.0\nThe elders frowned when they saw the white light. “Does he have no spirit root? Why did the Spirit Root Testing Crystal explode, then?”0\nBut the light intensified until it bathed the entire Daxia Sword Sect. The light even extended a thousand zhang into the sky.0\nThe powerful white light turned even the pitch-black stele completely white.0\nA strange voice appeared in Li Guanqi’s mind.0\n“State the candidate’s name.”0\n“Li Guanqi.”0\nAn invisible ripple surged outward, spanning a hundred li in all directions.0\nThen, the winds howled, and the clouds whirled as countless colorful lights orbited around the sect. They swam like colorful ribbons in the air, bringing with them a mysterious aura.0\nThe strange phenomenon shocked everyone. Then, one by one, the disciples erected protective arrays in the air to prevent outsiders from peeking in.0\nLi Guanqi’s name materialized at the bottom of the stele. It quickly climbed up the stele until it reached the first person’s name.0\nThe elders watched in shock as Li Guanqi’s name soared past the name that had not moved for ten thousand years, settling at the very top.0\nA row of gleaming golden characters materialized as the stele spirit’s voice resonated through the space.0\n“Li Guanqi, Saint Spirit Root. Empty Spirit Root.”4\nNo one knew what to do, and many were confused.0\n“What did it say? Empty Spirit Root? Doesn't that mean he has no spirit root at all? How could that qualify as a Saint Spirit Root?”0\nAmid the crowd’s noisy discussion, Zhao Yuanlin fixed his gaze on Li Guanqi, who stood calmly on the dais. 0\nIgnoring everyone’s confusion, the eight elders shamelessly surrounded Li Guanqi and quickly promoted their lineages. 0\n“Choose fire! Choose fire! It’s very destructive, and I can teach you how to forge weapons! Or refine pills!”0\nMeng Linhai panicked and knocked the elder with bushy eyebrows away. “Move! Our Metal Lineage has the most destructive power! Swordsmen are especially suited to the Metal Lineage—it’ll be like adding wings to a tiger![1].”0\n“Choose Water! The Heavenly Water Peak is an all-female peak! It’ll be easy for you to find a cultivation partner!”3\n“Choose Earth! We… Earth… Sigh, I’ll take you in as my closed-door disciple! I’ll give you my monthly allowance!”0\n“Come to the Heavenly Wood Peak! I’ll get the peak master to take you in as his closed-door disciple!”0\nA gentle cough interrupted the clamor. It was Qin Xian, the sect’s disciplinarian. He said solemnly, “I wouldn’t be opposed to taking a disciple myself.”0\nIn their frenzy, the eight elders disregarded his position as the disciplinarian. One of them cried out, “You haven’t taken a disciple in five hundred years! What could you possibly teach? Ah... no offense intended. Please don’t hold this against me later.”0\n“Peak Master! Hurry up and come here! Enough with the closed-door cultivation! There’s a disciple with a Saint Spirit Root here! If you’re late, you won’t get him!”0\n“Big Brother! Get out of your retreat! Come here and fight for your disciple!”0\nIn an instant, countless streaks of light—each one a person—shot forth from behind the mountain.0\nLi Guanqi felt himself pulled in every direction by countless hands. Even his robes began to tear.0\nThen came a stern cry.1\nThe group stiffened and stood quietly.0\nA man in blue robes arrived with a streak of light beneath his feet. He had an immortal quality with sharp brows and a determined expression.0\nThis was Lu Kangnian, the sect master of the Daxia Sword Sect and a Perfect Nascent Soul Realm cultivator!2\n1. Idiom. It means to improve something that is already good ☜0"

    "content": "Li Guanqi watched the situation unfold through his heart’s eye. At that moment, it felt as if Lu Kangnian was the only person who remained in the world.0\nLu Kangnian approached, standing on the colors of the sunset like an immortal and exuding the utmost sophistication. A person like that did not need to do anything for people to naturally look at them.0\n“Greetings, Sect Master!”0\n“Greetings, Sect Master!”0\nAt once, all elders and disciples stopped what they were doing and bowed to the figure in the sky.0\nLu Kangnian’s eyes swept across the whole plaza. “You’re all great elders of your respective peaks, yet here you are, squabbling like children! What a lack of discipline! Three months of allowance will be deducted from every elder!”0\nThe elders sulked bitterly when they heard him. Three months of allowance!0\nStill, against the sect master, they could only swallow their grievances and nod.0\nLan He glared at Lu Kangnian resentfully and muttered, “I won’t be able to afford my face powder for the next few months!”2\nLu Kangnian turned to her, his expression unmoved. “Lan He is fined an extra month for insubordination against the sect master. And you’ll be giving ten additional lectures to the outer sect this month.”0\nHe turned away, ignoring her murderous glare.0\nConversely, Li Guanqi found the dynamics at play quite compelling. The sect's culture is not bad at all.2\nEven the Heavenly Water Peak’s elder could joke around with the sect master. It was just one month’s allowance—nothing to an elder.2\nFurthermore, the sect master punished her by assigning extra lectures, which benefited the outer sect disciples.0\nLi Guanqi muttered, “Perhaps… this sect is a suitable place for me to stay.”0\nLu Kangnian gently descended upon the dais, his gaze drawn to the beautiful colors painting the sky. His eyes met Li Guanqi's as he offered a friendly smile. “I am Lu Kangnian, the thirty-eighth sect master of the Daxia Sword Sect. What is your name?”0\nAlthough Li Guanqi’s clothing did not look aristocratic, it was still clean and neat.0\nStraightening his collar, he offered an accurate, aristocratic salute. His composure, unwavering since the moment of his arrival, drew an approving glint in Lu Kangnian’s eyes.0\nZhao Yuanlin rose from the ground with great difficulty. He hurt all over, and it felt like he was being burned in a fire. However, his pain was nothing compared to his hatred.0\nHe glared at Lu Kangnian onstage, then turned to leave.0\nLi Guanqi took a long look at Zhao Yuanlin and narrowed his eyes. “Don’t move.”0\nThen, he turned around and saluted Lu Kangnian with one hand over his other fist. He asked solemnly, “May I settle a personal matter here?”0\nLu Kangnian’s eyes twinkled, and he gave a slight nod.0\nLi Guanqi turned to look at Zhao Yuanlin. Unrestrained killing intent radiated from him. “Since you tried to tarnish my reputation, I’m afraid you’re not going anywhere.”0\nZhao Yuanlin’s eyes filled with panic as he cradled his injured arm. “What… what do you want?! I won’t join the Daxia Sword Sect anymore. I’m going down the mountain now…”0\nLi Guanqi shot off and stood in front of him, blocking his retreat. “You and me. Death duel. Death is permissible in a death duel!”0\nZhao Yuanlin had long wanted to surrender. He did not dare look into Li Guanqi’s eyes. Hanging his head, he was about to refuse when an icy voice rang in his ear. 0\n“Prepare for a death duel! If you survive this, you will not be punished,” Lu Kangnian said, looking at Zhao Yuanlin.0\nLu Kangnian did not think a mere Heavenly Spirit Root was precious. The Daxia Sword Sect would never take in a disciple with such terrible character.0\nHis words were a death sentence to Zhao Yuanlin. There was a flash of gratitude in Li Guanqi’s eyes.0\nThe disciples backed away to form a space with a thirty-zhang radius.0\nZhao Yuanlin’s pale face betrayed his realization that there was no way out. All he could do was fight for his life…0\nHe clenched his teeth and looked at Lu Kangnian. “If I win, let me leave!”0\nLu Kangnian reappeared on a throne onstage in a flash. He smirked. “Of course. Even if you stay, the Daxia Sword Sect won’t want you.”0\nZhao Yuanlin took a deep breath and stood before Li Guanqi, glaring venomously. He would have joined the inner sect if it hadn’t been for Li Guanqi.2\nDisciplinarian Qin Xian personally refereed the death duel.0\n“All techniques are allowed in this death duel. It will end when one person dies! Begin!”0\nLi Guanqi shot out like an arrow, the sword coffin still strapped to his back.0\nThe disciples only saw a blurry silhouette due to his incredible speed, even losing track of his location.0\nWhen the elders saw this, they nodded with approval. It was rare to see someone achieve such speed through pure physical strength.0\nZhao Yuanlin reacted with a punch but missed the mark.0\nA murderous intent gradually filled Li Guanqi’s eyes. Now crouching, he threw a fist at Zhao Yuanlin’s jaw.0\nCrack!0\nZhao Yuanlin’s jaw shattered. Blood flowed, and his teeth fell as he was thrown back into the air.0\nLi Guanqi grabbed Zhao Yuanlin’s ankle and slammed him into the ground.0\nSlam!0\nBlood splattered on the ground, and Zhao Yuanlin cried out in agony, bouncing off the ground from the impact. Cracks appeared on the stone tiles.0\nHis internal organs had been either shattered or displaced by the powerful force.0\nZhao Yuanlin swept his leg at Li Guanqi, who then let go of his ankle. The tip of Zhao Yuanlin’s foot brushed past the tip of Li Guanqi’s nose.0\nZhao Yuanlin stabilized himself in the air and then vomited a mouthful of blood. His eyes were covered in blood spots, and his vision was so blurry he could not see what was in front of him.0\nA mass of shadows swept past him. Zhao Yuanlin’s features contorted as he roared and threw the strongest punch he could.0\nLi Guanqi’s expression had not changed since the beginning. He braced himself, leaped sideways, and punched.0\nThud! Crack! 0\nZhao Yuanlin’s left arm snapped.0\nLi Guanqi straightened his fingers in a knife-like gesture and roared, “Die!”0\nHis five fingers had pierced through Zhao Yuanlin’s chest, puncturing his heart.0\nThud. 0\nZhao Yuanlin fell to his knees, his eyes lifeless. 0\nLi Guanqi pulled out his right hand, and blood dripped down his fingers onto the ground. He stood motionless with his eyes closed. 0\nTears pooled in the corners of his eyes as he muttered hoarsely, “Elder Sister… I have finally avenged you.”1\nThe disciples in the plaza, who had witnessed the whole incident, were too frightened to make a sound.0\nOn the other hand, the peak elders were smiling and nodding. Li Guanqi was able to kill decisively. Lu Kangnian’s eyes lit up and his smile widened.0\nThe peak elders whispered to each other using Divine Consciousness Voice Transmission.0\n“Did you see that? Old Lu definitely came here to snatch him away!”0\n“Tsk tsk. He said he had ‘closed his doors’[1] after taking in Wu Bing, but now he’s opening them back up!”0\n“Lu Kangnian is so shameless! How could he change his mind so casually?”0\nLu Kangnian swept his gaze nonchalantly across the group, and they fell silent.0\n“Li Guanqi, is this your first time testing out your spirit root?”0\nLi Guanqi calmed his nerves and nodded as he watched Zhao Yuanlin’s body being carried away. “Well, my grandfather always smiled and kept quiet whenever I asked him about it. I didn’t know what spirit root I had either.”0\nLu Kangnian had just examined Li Guanqi’s bones and tendons and found them to be of superior quality. Despite only being in the Body Tempering Realm, Li Guanqi had extremely hardy internal organs, as well as strong meridians, tendons, and bones. He was anything but ordinary.0\n“Would it be alright for you to tell me your grandfather’s name?”0\n“Su Xuan.”1\n“Su Xuan… I’ve never heard of any Nascent Soul Realm cultivator with this name… It doesn’t matter. In that case, let me explain why this is called an Empty Spirit Root.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded. Lu Kangnian explained to the crowd, “The most valuable part of having an Empty Spirit Root is that the cultivator can choose any of the Eight Lineages as his own spirit root!”0\nThe candidates all drew in a sharp breath. They looked at Li Guanqi with admiration and respect.0\n“Furthermore, the element he picks will have a purity level far surpassing a Heavenly Spirit Root! Imagine if a Triple Lineage Spirit Root’s cultivation speed is equivalent to using one bucket to fill up a water tank. Then, a Double Lineage True Spirit Root is the same as using four buckets, the Generating True Spirit Root six buckets, and a Single Heavenly Spirit Root ten buckets!” Lu Kangnian said.0\nLu Kangnian turned to look at Li Guanqi and continued gently, “The King Spirit Root is fifteen, then Saint Spirit Root is… twenty!”0\nThe power of the spirit roots amazed the crowd. As the countless masters of this world often said, a cultivator’s upper limit was determined by their natural talent.0\nA person with lesser talent could only close part of the gap through personal effort when compared to someone with more talent. Sometimes, hard, bitter work was useless. This was brutal, but it was also the reality of embarking on the journey of cultivation. 0\nSometimes, people experienced extraordinary events that completely changed their physical structure, remade their spirit roots, and turned them into powerful masters. However, it was unheard of for a person with a Triple Spirit Root to progress beyond the Nascent Soul Realm.0\nLi Guanqi asked, “Are there more levels above the Saint Spirit Root?”0\nLu Kangnian looked at the knowledge-hungry expressions of the youths offstage and smirked. “Yes!”0\n“Wow! There are more powerful spirit roots beyond the Heavenly Spirit Root!”0\n“Good heavens… Now I see why all sects want to test our spirit roots and check our natural-born talent! This is… Sigh!”0\nLu Kangnian said gently, “A person with a Heavenly Spirit Root is a prodigy. King Spirit Roots are even rarer—only one in ten thousand. Those with King Spirit Roots are known as Children of the Heavens.0\n“The Saint Spirit Root all depends on one’s karma—it is so rare that only one appears every thousand years. People with such spirit roots are borderline inhuman prodigies.4\n“Above the Saint Spirit Root is the Divine Spirit Root. People with this spirit root are those with extreme luck, and its quality is extremely high. Its cultivation speed is the equivalent of… thirty buckets of water.0\n“Rumor has it that in one of the Six Territories, the daughter of the Divine Treasure territorial lord recently awakened her Ice Saint Spirit Root.”8\nThen, he smiled and said, “Alright, I won’t go too deep into matters about other territories. I only talked about it to expand your horizons a little. Even a King Spirit Root is very rare in the Daxia Territory, let alone the Azure Cloud Continent.0\n“To have a disciple with a Saint Spirit Root is enough to make a sect prosper for generations. It will make the Daxia Sword Sect strong and powerful! It is a cause for celebration!0\n“Today, any candidates with at least a Triple Spirit Root may join our sect! You will be initially assigned to the outer sect!”1\nThe crowd erupted in cheers. Those candidates who were initially not chosen because they had False Spirit Roots cheered even more.0\n“So, Li Guanqi… Which lineage will you pick?” Lu Kangnian asked.0\nEvery peak elder and peak master waited for Li Guanqi’s answer with bated breath. Lu Kangnian had an Earth Spirit Root. As long as Li Guanqi did not pick the Earth Lineage, they all stood a chance.0\nLi Guanqi was also a swordsman. Swordsmen could unleash maximum destructive force through a Metal Spirit Root.0\nSuddenly, he was plunged into a strange, profound state. He seemed to be standing in a white, misty world. Eight floating light spheres approached him.0\nAn unexpected sensation washed over him as he reached out to touch the golden sphere.0\nHe turned to look to the side. 0\n1. ”Closed his doors” means he had decided to stop taking in disciples. ☜0"

    "content": "Silence fell as Li Guanqi picked his spirit root. Lu Kangnian had used an impressive technique to shroud him with an earth-yellow shield made of vital force.0\nThe shield shut out the noisy surroundings and concealed him from the people outside.0\nEveryone was curious about which spirit root this inhuman prodigy would select.0\nThe Heavenly Metal Peak’s elder, Meng Linhai, coughed and laughed. “Sect Leader, doesn’t the thing strapped to his back look like a large sword box? We are the Daxia Sword Sect, after all. In my opinion, the boy will surely choose the Metal Spirit Root.”0\nThe other peak masters and elders exchanged glances but held their tongues. They couldn’t rebuke him even if they wanted to.0\nLu Kangnian replied with an insincere smile, “You’re speaking like you can see what he’s doing now.”0\n“What if… Cough cough. What if he picks Earth?”0\nThe Heavenly Lightning Peak’s second elder, Xu Zhengjie, pursed his lips and muttered, “Aiya~ There’s no way he’s going to pick Earth… If he picks Earth, I’m eating three jin of Renzhong Huang.[1]”0\nLu Kangnian had sharp senses, so he heard Xu Zhengjie’s muttering. Staring directly at Xu Zhengjie with gritted teeth, he used voice transmission and said, “Good! Very good! You shall be responsible for finishing up all the Renzhong Huang in Heavenly Pillar Peak this month!”0\nXu Zhengjie’s face fell in utter horror.0\nSuddenly, the wind howled and the clouds whirled. Thick storm clouds now obscured the once-colorful sky, and soon after, rain began to fall.0\nLan He stepped forward and waved gently, instantly blocking the rainwater out of the space they were in.0\n“What’s going on?!”0\nRumble!0\nAs the sky darkened, a bolt of pitch-black lightning flashed across the sky. 0\nXu Zhengjie burst into triumphant laughter. “To hell with Metal! The Heavenly Lightning Peak’s Lightning Spirit Root is the true master!”0\nThe shield disappeared. Li Guanqi looked at the exasperated Lu Kangnian and calmly bowed. “I have chosen the Lightning Lineage!”0\nLu Kangnian wiped the disappointment off his face and smiled. He patted Li Guanqi’s shoulder. “Haha, it’s alright, as long as you follow your heart. I thought I would be gaining a disciple today.”0\nLu Kangnian glared at Xu Zhengjie, who was so happy he was dancing. He sighed. “It looks like we’ll need to allocate more resources to the Heavenly Lightning Peak in the future.0\n“Disciple Li Guanqi shall enter Heavenly Lightning Peak! He has awakened his Saint Lightning Spirit Root. The peak shall be awarded three Qi Refining Pills, three hundred spirit stones, five hundred Sect Contribution Points, and a new courtyard! 0\n“Furthermore, the disciples of Heavenly Lightning Peak are now permitted to use the Spirit Ascension Platform three times without needing to spend contribution points.”0\nLi Guanqi quickly straightened his posture and replied respectfully, “Thank you for the generosity, Sect Master.”0\nXu Zhengjie was even happier. He bowed and said, “Thank you for being so generous, Sect Master! I’ll handle everything related to the Heavenly Pillar Peak!”0\nSome elders were still trying to persuade Li Guanqi, but Xu Zhengjie promptly approached him and whisked him away, soaring through the clouds toward Heavenly Lightning Peak.0\n“Wow…”0\nLi Guanqi could not help but cry out in surprise. This was his first time flying, and the experience was seared into his memory.0\nHe looked down without a word and clenched his fists. He swore to continue cultivating so that one day, he would also soar into the sky, flying freely with a sword at his side.0\nXu Zhengjie watched Li Guanqi with a knowing smile, reminiscing about himself one century ago. Back then, he’d been terrified of the height—nothing like this fearless youth beside him!0\nFeeling Xu Zhengjie’s gaze upon him, Li Guanqi asked, “May I know your name?”0\nXu Zhengjie laughed and said warmly, “I am the Second Elder of Heavenly Lightning Peak, Xu Zhengjie. You can call me Elder Xu, Old Xu, or Old Drunkard.”1\nLi Guanqi smiled. “I’ll just call you Elder Xu then. The others are a little too… inappropriate.”0\nXu Zhengjie did not respond, but he appreciated Li Guanqi’s respect for his elders.0\nLi Guanqi asked, “Elder Xu, why does the Daxia Sword Sect want a blind person like me?”0\n“Hahahahaha! Your eyes may be blind, but your heart isn’t! Whoever your grandfather is, he’s raised quite a remarkable child. That thing on your back must be two hundred jin!”0\nLi Guanqi smiled shyly. “Five hundred jin.”0\n“Ah... Forget what I said...” Xu Zhengjie cleared his throat. “But the Daxia Sword Sect...”0\nXu Zhengjie’s tone grew gentle. “This is a sect worth sacrificing my life for. So what if you’re blind? So what if you’re a cripple? If you hold the Dao in your heart, you will overcome any shortcomings!”1\nHis words struck Li Guanqi like lightning. As long as I hold the Dao in my heart, I can overcome anything…0\nAmazing! Daxia Sword Sect! So this is why Grandfather insisted on this specific sect.0\nXu Zhengjie smiled and said, “Let’s go. I’ll take you to the quarters to settle down. I still need to go back and see if I can recruit more disciples. The Heavenly Lightning Peak may have few people, but we are very united.”0\nWhoosh!0\nLi Guanqi quietly savored everything at that moment. He closed his eyes and enjoyed the wind roaring in his ear. Both of them swept past a flock of geese, and Li Guanqi reached out to touch a geese’s feathers. The goose honked with annoyance and flew further away from them.0\nThe corners of Li Guanqi’s lips curved up into a gentle smile.0\nSoon after, they approached a mountain so massive its peak pierced through the clouds. Along the way, they had already passed many other tall mountain peaks0\nNo wonder people spoke of the Daxia Sword Sect’s “three thousand strange peaks and eight hundred rivers.”0\nCrack!0\nA barrier containing the power of lightning appeared in front of them. Xu Zhengjie took out a jade slip, opening a gap in the boundary.0\n“The boundary detected an unfamiliar presence—you. That’s why it appeared,” Xu Zhengie explained. “After tomorrow’s disciple initiation ceremony, you’ll receive your own identity jade slip. Then you’ll be able to enter Heavenly Lightning Peak without triggering the boundary.”0\nAs they went up the mountain, countless large pavilions, pagodas, and buildings could be seen. Xu Zhengjie smiled and said, “Your courtyard is halfway up the mountain. It’s a convenient location, and it's easy to go anywhere from there. Your courtyard even has a small spirit field. The sect master has high hopes for you.”0\nLi Guanqi was puzzled. “Why would he give me so many things? Isn’t it too…”0\nXu Zhengjie smiled. “Too much?” 0\n“It is a bit much. I am both surprised and flattered.”0\nXu Zhengjie rested both hands on his back. “It’s not too much… The Daxia Sword Sect hasn’t been prosperous in recent years. We’re not particularly wealthy.0\n“If this were another sect, you would have received even more. Other major sects would shower you with spirit stones, magical treasures, techniques, and scriptures. They’d even let you marry a clan leader’s eldest daughter if you wanted!”0\nDespite the disbelief written on Li Guanqi’s face, Xu Zhengjie continued, “But… this is the Daxia Sword Sect. If you want something, you must rely on your efforts to get it!0\n“Alright, here’s your courtyard. I’ll be returning to the plaza. I’ll explain everything about the sect later. You should get some rest today. Oh, and goodbye, Little Bao~”0\nBefore Li Guanqi could process Xu Zhengjie’s words, he had vanished into thin air.0\nLi Guanqi turned around and saw a little girl about six or seven years old squatting at the entrance of his courtyard. Her hair was styled in two braided pigtails, complemented by a brightly patterned coat.0\nHer large round eyes and rosy cheeks made her quite the adorable sight. She held onto a white bao[2] with both hands while staring at him intently.0\nLi Guanqi scratched his head. He didn’t know whose child this was.0\nHe approached and squatted next to her. Before he could speak, the little girl stuffed the bao into her pocket and shot off, glaring at him as if afraid he would take her bao away. 0\n1. Renzhong Huang (人中黄) is a traditional Chinese medicine made of licorice and human feces. An empty bamboo segment is filled with licorice and sealed with wood, then placed in a squat toilet, which is a hole in the ground, so that human feces seep into it. It’s used to treat inflammatory conditions. ☜2\n2. Steamed bun. ☜0"

    "content": "Li Guanqi was momentarily bewildered, wondering whose child that was.0\n“That girl has a strong physique but looks no older than five or six.”0\nHe did not dwell on the matter and pushed open the courtyard door.0\nAs soon as he stepped inside, he was stunned. The place was breathtaking. Compared to this, his home in Prosperity Village was practically a pigsty…0\nA stream flowing down from a spring atop Heavenly Lightning Peak wound its way through the front yard. A small bridge arched over the water, with strange rocks scattered around and various conifer trees standing tall.0\nPassing a stone table, he entered the house and found himself in a vast main hall roughly six zhang wide. The furniture was all brand new and made of redwood.0\nBeyond the main hall were three bedrooms—one master room and two guest rooms.0\nThe environment here was just perfect. There was even a small piece of land in his backyard for the spirit garden. The soil was nearly black, dusted with a layer of green powder—likely the fertilizer used to maintain the spirit garden’s soil.0\nA gentle knocking came at the door. Li Guanqi hurried over to open it, but before he could, a soft voice called out, “Junior Brother, slow down~ No need to rush.”0\nLi Guanqi was surprised for a moment. Heavenly Lightning Peak disciples? Didn’t Elder Xu say the disciple initiation ceremony would be tomorrow?0\nCreak~0\nHe opened the courtyard door to find seven or eight people standing outside, all slightly older than him.0\nEach of them wore a warm smile. One carried a cotton bundle, while others held essentials like a wooden tub.0\nWhen they saw the strip of cloth tied around his eyes, their eyes flashed with heartache.0\nThey wore white sect robes with a bolt of purple lightning embroidered down their shoulders. A flag on their chests displayed a purple “雷” (lightning) character.1\nThis group's leader was a tanned girl who looked about eighteen or nineteen. Her hair was tied in a high ponytail, and her face was shaped like a goose egg. Her features were delicate, and she had large, bright eyes.0\nThe girl looked authoritatively at the people beside her, then pointed at his eyes, suggesting they watch their words.0\n“Greetings, Junior Brother. I am a disciple of Heavenly Lightning Peak’s second elder. My name is Gu Ran. You just need to call me Senior Sister, hahaha,” she said warmly.0\nShe pointed at the other disciples. “They are also disciples of the Heavenly Lightning Peak—your senior brothers. We came here to check on you, just in case you didn’t have a cotton pad for your bed.”0\nLi Guanqi quickly stepped aside and saluted them with a smile. “I am Li Guanqi. Greetings, Senior Brothers and Senior Sister.”0\nHe continued, “Don’t stand at the door. Come in and have a seat.”0\nGu Ran gestured for the rest to enter. A few tall senior brothers made a beeline for the master bedroom, unrolling the cotton pad and blanket for Li Guanqi.0\nLooking at the busy group, Li Guanqi felt his heart stir.0\nHe had always kept his past experiences hidden in the depths of his heart. Even his current personality stemmed from gradual changes since living with Su Xuan. Perhaps he had also intentionally imitated his grandfather’s nonchalant personality.0\nGu Ran came to his side and grabbed his arm, leading him on a very slow walk.0\n“Walk slowly as you get familiar with the layout. There’s a step beneath your foot here. In ten steps, you’ll reach a stone bridge. To your right is a stone table, and to your left is a pond. Be careful when walking back later.0\n“I picked up your sect uniform from Internal Affairs. Try it on later to see if it fits. If it doesn’t, I’ll exchange it for another set.0\n“From now on, consider Heavenly Lightning Peak your home. We’re your family. If you ever need help, just shout ‘Heavenly Lightning Peak’ at the sky. We’ll do our best to help you out!0\n“If anyone dares bully you, just tell me. Sister Gu will stand up for you.”0\nDespite the long introduction, they had not descended the bridge yet, showing just how slowly they were walking. She continued to lead him slowly by holding his arm.0\n“Big Head! Wrap some bamboo around the corners of the furniture. Don’t just stand there.”0\nThe tallest young man smiled sheepishly and said hurriedly, “Alright, Senior Sister.”0\n“Little Junior Brother, if you end up being the only one Elder Xu recruits today, you’re going to be the youngest disciple of Heavenly Lightning Peak. Haha.”0\n“If you need anything, just look for Senior Sister Gu! That’s what I did when I first arrived. Sometimes, I feel like she’s more worried about me than my actual mother.”0\n“Big Head, are you itching for extra training? Hmm?”0\n“Hahahaha! You’re always asking for a scolding, brat.”0\n“It’s been three years! Finally, I have a junior brother.”0\nListening to their sibling-like bickering, Li Guanqi felt like he had entered another world. Their voices were like the warmth of spring sunlight or a gentle mountain stream, like a warm current that seeped into his heart.0\nTears slipped from the black cloth covering his eyes.0\nHe could endure Zhao Yuanlin humiliating him before the crowd, claiming that he had sold his sister for money.0\nHe could admit to everyone that he was a blind, lowly beggar.0\nHe could even laugh at those who mocked him, comparing them to dogs barking for no reason.0\nHowever, he could not endure a drop of concern shown by a few strangers.0\nDrip!0\nGu Ran paused, then quietly wiped his face with her hand. She looked at the others and muttered, “What are you all looking at? Don’t you all have things to do? Hurry up, we have to start cultivating in half an hour!”0\nThen, she gently handed Li Guanqi a set of brand-new white robes and said, “Go change into these. Let’s see if they fit.”0\nLi Guanqi smiled. Hugging the clothes, he said softly, “Thank you, senior brothers and senior sister. I’m honored to be your junior brother.”0\nHe started to bend down. He saw that everyone avoided him, but he still proceeded to bow. Gu Ran reached over and tugged at one of the guys’ hair, stopping him before he could say something foolish.0\nLi Guanqi got up and smirked. “Senior Sister, if you pull Senior Brother’s hair again, he’s going to go bald…”0\nAs he spoke, he turned his head as if looking directly at her.0\nGu Ran froze, then waved her hand in front of his eyes. She said cautiously, “You can’t see, can you?”0\nLi Guanqi removed the strip of cloth to reveal his shocking white eyes.0\n“I am completely blind, but… I have opened my heart’s eye.”0\n“What? This brat tricked us!”0\n“Yeah! I thought he actually couldn’t see! I’d just finished wrapping the corners of this table!”0\n“Brothers! Beat him up!”0\nEveryone swarmed over, then tackled and wrestled Li Guanqi playfully.0\nIn the end, a few of them said, “It’s time for us to go! See you guys at the Martial Arena. I want to challenge Senior Sister today!”0\n“Tsk~ You think you’d win? We’ll see.”0\n“Also, should we take a few jobs tomorrow? I’ve been so broke recently…”0\nAs the group departed, Gu Ran looked at Li Guanqi in his new white robes and nodded approvingly. “Not bad! A handsome guy like you should wear white!0\n“That sword box of yours is gigantic. Did an older relative give it to you? Is there a sword inside?”0\nLi Guanqi scratched his head. He did not know what was inside either.0\nGu Ran grinned, then turned to leave. “Rest up, Junior Brother. The disciple initiation ceremony starts at seven sharp tomorrow. Don’t be late.”0\nAfter everyone had left, Li Guanqi looked at the room, which was different from when he arrived. 0\nThe corners of his lips curled into a soft, contented smile.0\nThat night, he slept very soundly.6"

    "content": "The next morning, Li Guanqi was already up and had made his bed by the hour of the Rabbit.[1]0\nHe did his punching routine tens of times in his backyard, boosting his blood circulation and drenching him in sweat.0\nHe looked up at the brightening sky, then finally set down the sword box on his back. After that, he heated some water for a bath.0\nHe still did not know why his grandfather called this sword box a sword coffin.0\nMeanwhile, the main pavilion of Heavenly Lightning Peak was bustling with activity. Nearly all the disciples had gathered there.0\nLi Guanqi was the first new disciple of Heavenly Lightning Peak in three years. And not just any disciple—he possessed the legendary Saint Spirit Root. He was an inhuman prodigy!0\nIn a courtyard behind Heavenly Lightning Peak, a young girl in a flowery coat had just spent all her energy hanging up clothes to dry. She squatted by the door, pulled out a bao from her pocket, and took a bite.0\nHalf the bao disappeared into her mouth in just one bite. The fragrant filling burst forth, coating her lips in grease.0\n“Grandfather Li, aren’t you attending the disciple initiation ceremony today?”0\nA drunken voice came from inside the house. “Nope.”0\nThe young girl nodded as if the answer did not surprise her. Then, she continued, “The Saint Spirit Root chose the Lightning Lineage. And he’s blind.”0\nA soft snoring came in reply. The young girl rose and ran excitedly to the main hall. She raised both her arms, running like a goose with outstretched wings.0\n***0\n“Guanqi! Over here!” Gu Ran called out as Li Guanqi strode quickly toward the main hall, the sword box still strapped to his back.0\nA crowd had already gathered in the hundred-zhang-wide plaza. Every disciple of Heavenly Lightning Peak was present, along with Sect Master Lu Kangnian and several peak elders. They all wanted to see who this prodigy would pick as his master.0\nOf the three main leaders of the Heavenly Lightning Peak, however, only Xu Zhengjie had shown up.0\nHeavenly Lightning Peak had one peak master, two peak elders, and thirty-seven disciples.0\nThe peak master, Lei Yingze, had reached the Perfect Golden Core Realm and was currently in closed-door cultivation, seeking a breakthrough into the Nascent Soul Realm.0\nThe first peak elder rarely appeared in public, leaving Second Elder Xu Zhengjie to oversee all affairs of Heavenly Lightning Peak.0\nWhen Lu Kangnian saw that Li Guanqi had arrived but Xu Zhengjie was still alone, he frowned. “Hmmph. Is Li Nanting not coming, even on a day like this?”0\nNo one aside from Lu Kangnian had the authority or guts to make such a remark. The Heavenly Lightning Peak’s Grand Elder, Li Nanting, had a unique position in the Daxia Sword Sect. Not a single peak elder dared to joke around in front of Li Nanting—after all, he had once been the Daxia Sword Sect’s disciplinarian.0\nThere was a flash, and a white-robed person suddenly appeared next to Lu Kangnian. His posture was as straight as a sword, his face angular, and his gaze sharp as an eagle’s. He was old, but one wouldn’t guess his age by how he carried himself.0\nLu Kangnian looked at the man, then chuckled and said, “I thought you weren’t coming.”0\nThe old man also chuckled and replied, “Heavenly Lightning Peak hasn’t been this noisy in three years. I’ve got to come no matter what.”0\nLu Kangnian nodded. “Where’s Little Bao?”0\n“There.”0\nLi Nanting pointed at the roof of the main pavilion. A little girl in a flowery coat was sprawled on her stomach, munching on a carrot. Only her head peeked out.0\nLu Kangnian waved, and the girl flew up into his arms.0\nLu Kangnian pressed her delicate cheeks to his scruffy face, making her frown. She stuffed the carrot into his mouth.0\nHe laughed and let her sit on his shoulders.0\n“Since everyone has arrived, the disciple initiation ceremony of Li Guanqi shall begin! Sound the drums! Light the incense sticks! Prayers to the ancestors!”0\nDong! Dong dong!0\nMore than a hundred disciples hit the war drums in a booming rhythm.0\nA copper cauldron about one zhang in width landed in the pavilion's center.0\nThen, one by one, over thirty one-zhang-tall stone statues landed. Each was carved so intricately that they looked almost alive. These were all the former sect masters of the Daxia Sword Sect.0\nLu Kangnian’s voice echoed across the whole sect.0\n“The Daxia Sword Sect has stood for 13,298 years and has been led by thirty-eight sect masters. One has passed the Tribulation Realm to ascend to immortality, two were at the Mahayana Stage, three at the Combined Body Realm, five at the Illusory Refinement Realm, and fifteen at the Divine Transformation Realm!2\n“After today, you will be a disciple of the Daxia Sword Sect for the rest of your life! You shall embark on the journey of cultivation, and as long as you maintain your virtues, the sect will stand behind you!0\n“These are the sect rules!0\n“The sword in your hand must never be raised against the weak. The sword in your heart must never falter before the strong!0\n“Restore fairness where there is none. Kill those who must be killed!0\n“If one day you meet a strong enemy while upholding our rules, the Daxia Sword Sect will use everything in its power to ensure your safety!0\n“Li Guanqi, are you willing to join the Daxia Sword Sect? To join the Heavenly Lightning Peak?”0\nLi Guanqi stood tall, slowly untying the cloth covering his eyes. He met Lu Kangnian’s gaze with his pure white eyes. Then, he raised the incense stick in his hands and said solemnly, “I, Li Guanqi, am willing to join the Daxia Sword Sect! I will join the Heavenly Lightning Peak!”0\nDong dong dong dong dong!0\nThe war drums echoed across the whole Heavenly Lightning Peak.0\nLu Kangnian said solemnly, “Make the incense offering! The initiation ceremony has officially ended!”0\nThe following rituals were very simple. Lu Kangnian approached Li Guanqi and handed him a small, white jade slip no larger than his palm. 0\nEtched on it was the symbol of the Daxia Sword Sect. His name and an engraving of Heavenly Lightning Peak were on the reverse side.0\n“This is your identity jade slip. Never lose it! Take your time to study and figure out its uses.”0\nLu Kangnian turned to the other old man, who seemed difficult to get along with. “So… Li Nanting, do you want to take him in as a disciple?”0\nSecond Elder Xu Zhengjie glared at Lu Kangnian resentfully. The sect master had not even asked him or Heavenly Lightning Peak’s peak master.0\nLi Guanqi stood there without a word. He did not mind if the sect master chose a suitable master for him.0\n“Why must it be me? Old Xu can do it too.”0\nLu Kangnian shook his head. “In all these years, the Daxia Sword Sect has only had two disciples with this much potential. Since he chose the Lightning Lineage, you’re the most suited in Heavenly Lightning Peak to be his master.0\n“Among the eight peak elders, you’re the only one who has mastered swordsmanship, cultivation techniques, Lightning Soul Power, and spellcraft. I wouldn’t entrust him to anyone else.”0\nLi Nanting fell silent. He had lived in solitude for so long, answering to no one. But… this was a disciple with a Saint Spirit Root.0\nHis chances of attaining the Nascent Soul Realm in this lifetime were incredibly low. He really wanted to pass down the knowledge he had accumulated over his life.0\nThe previous candidate, Wu Bing, had a Metal Lineage Spirit Root, so he was unsuitable to become Li Nanting’s disciple.0\nHe took a step toward Li Guanqi and bent slightly.0\n“Kid,” he said softly. “I’ll take you as my disciple. Are you willing to… become my disciple?”0\nThe old man’s voice was shaking, and he seemed uncomfortable.0\nHowever, Li Guanqi sensed the sincerity and cautiousness in the old man. There was also hope in the old man’s eyes, which startled Li Guanqi. 0\nThen, Li Guanqi lifted the hem of his robes and slowly knelt. “I, Li Guanqi, am willing to take you as my master!”0\nLi Nanting’s eyes reddened as he teared up. Looking up at the sky, his voice trembled. “Good… Good! Good!”1\nHe helped Li Guanqi to his feet and then looked around.0\n“From this day onward, I, Li Nanting, take Li Guanqi as my closed-door disciple! All eight peak elders shall take good care of him!”0\n1. 卯时 - Hour of the Rabbit, from 5 to 7 AM. ☜0"

    "content": "The other seven peak elders nodded in agreement. They all knew how capable Li Nanting was, and given Li Guanqi’s talent, it was only natural for him to take the boy in—despite having gone so long without accepting a disciple. 0\nNo one wanted to live in vain; they all wished to pass on their knowledge to the next generation.0\nThe crowd dispersed.0\nLi Nanting led Li Guanqi back to his courtyard, where they performed a simple initiation ritual: a kowtow and a tea ceremony. With that, it was done.0\nLi Nanting said gently, “Guanqi, fate has let us become master and disciple. I don’t have much to give, but I shall give you this pill.”0\nWhoosh!0\nA flash of light flickered from the ring on his left hand, and a jade box appeared in his palm.0\nLi Guanqi accepted it with care. When he opened it, he saw a round, shiny pill. It was even flickering with a soft glow.0\n“Master, this is…”0\nLi Nanting smiled. “It’s a top-tier Foundation Building Pill.”0\nLi Guanqi froze. He closed the box gently and pushed it back to Li Nanting. “No, no. Master, this is too valuable. You should keep it.”0\nLi Nanting chuckled. “I’ve already given it to you, so keep it. This is the only thing I have that’s truly worth something. The sect master had also intended to give you one, but these pills attract too much attention. He feared it would cause trouble for you and decided to wait. He’ll give it to you once you’ve refined ten layers of qi.”0\nHe continued, “But I am different. Since I have it now, I’ll give it to you now!”0\nBut Li Guanqi insisted, “Master, I don’t think I could even sleep with something so precious by my side. What if I leave it with you for now? You can give it to me when I need it.”0\nLi Nanting did not say much, seeing as Li Guanqi remained adamant. He put the jade box away and nodded. “Very well, I’ll hold onto it for you.”0\n“Hmm… I can see that you have a strong physique, and your Body Tempering Realm foundations are excellent!” Li Nanting said. “Did you have a senior teaching you at home?”0\nLi Guanqi scratched his head as he recalled his grandfather’s strict teachings. “I've been taking medicinal baths since childhood thanks to my grandfather. He told me to go up and down the mountain with heavy weights every day. He also had me practice my punching routine. Over time, I became like this.”0\nLi Nanting’s eyes twinkled. No wonder he’d sensed a fresh, herbal fragrance from Li Guanqi when they first met.0\n“Did your grandfather also give you the thing you’re carrying on your back? Is it a sword box? But it doesn’t seem like it… It’s far too large, and it’s also made of stone.”0\nLi Guanqi scratched his head again. “My grandfather gave it to me before he left. But he said this is a sword coffin, not a sword box.”1\nBoom!0\nWith a wave of his hand, the wooden doors of the main pavilion slammed shut. Then, he formed a barrier around them with vital force.0\nLi Guanqi blinked, confused by the sudden cautiousness.0\nLi Nanting stood up, his expression solemn. “From now on, if anyone asks, always say it’s a sword box!”0\n“Why?”0\n“Why…?” Li Nanting let out a heavy breath. “Because people may covet it! They may kill you for it! It’s a sword coffin! Only magical or ancient treasure swords need to be sealed like this!0\n“Items are categorized from low to high like this: mundane, magical, spirit, magical treasure, ancient treasure, spirit treasure, and heavenly spirit treasure!”0\nLi Guanqi finally understood just how valuable his sword coffin was.0\nLi Nanting continued, “Even a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator would struggle to obtain an ancient treasure sword! Many Nascent Soul Realm cultivators still use magical treasure items. Never reveal your valuables. You must be cautious.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded, committing his master’s words to memory.0\nThen, Li Nanting retracted the vital force shield and studied him thoughtfully. “It looks like your grandfather is a cultivator too. And his cultivation level is surely quite high… He let you carry an ancient treasure sword so generously.”0\nLi Guanqi rubbed his nose awkwardly. He did not know how high his grandfather’s cultivation level was.0\nLi Nanting sat on a chair, gesturing for Li Guanqi to sit on the chair before him. He took a second to gather his thoughts, then said, “Why do you want to be an immortal?”0\nLi Guanqi was silent for a long time before answering. 0\n“To live a long life, fly everywhere on a sword, become an excellent swordsman, and achieve freedom in my heart.”0\nLi Nanting smiled warmly. He pointed at Li Guanqi. “It’s not easy to have such an understanding at your age. But… some people say that immortals live a carefree life. 0\n“They say that immortals are virtuous, peaceful, and kind. 0\n“That they drive out evil and help the heavens enforce the Dao.0\n“That they enjoy the world's wonders and live their long lives peacefully.0\n“That they observe the changes of ten thousand generations while they sit and drink wine, never changing themselves.0\n“That is indeed an immortal, but it is not the complete picture.”0\nLi Guanqi listened intently, absorbed in his master’s description of immortals.0\nBut then, Li Nanting’s tone sharpened. His voice rose with passion. “I have a different picture of an immortal!”0\nLi Guanqi asked curiously, “Why?”0\nLi Nanting’s eyes shone. He stood up and looked up at the sky. “The journey of cultivation is long. There is endless manipulation and trickery along the way! 0\n“Of course, you cannot avoid bloodshed. When an important treasure appears, everyone scrambles after it, even fighting to the death. Once you reach the Nascent Soul Realm, you even need to endure a small Heavenly Tribulation once every three hundred years.”0\nHe suddenly turned to look at Li Guanqi. “That’s why, to me, the journey to immortality is as vast as the ocean—once you step in, there is no turning back. To be immortal is to fight!”0\nLi Guanqi looked confused. “Fight?”0\nLi Nanting replied, “That’s right! You fight other people! You fight the earth! You fight the heavens!0\n“You fight for spirit qi! For luck! For opportunities!0\n“Life is complicated. It will bring you both joy and sorrow. You’ll meet good people, but you’ll also meet demons.0\n“To cultivate is to defy the will of the heavens themselves! You’re taking the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth, forging an impenetrable body to soar across the skies.0\n“The road ahead is paved with thorns. If a mountain stands in your way, carve a tunnel through it. If a river blocks your path, build a bridge and cross. Wield the sword in your hand and carve out your own path to greatness!”3\nLi Nanting spoke fervently, pouring his wisdom of centuries into his words.0\nHe hoped this short lesson would make the boy understand some concepts earlier than he did. These learnings had come from the countless hardships he endured in his lifetime.0\nHe did not want Li Guanqi to become evil and hardened, nor did he want him to be excessively soft or kind.0\nLi Guanqi’s once-innocent gaze now carried something more. He bowed respectfully. “Master, I can’t fully understand yet, but I will remember your words.”1\nLi Nanting looked at Li Guanqi. He did not offer reassurances like, “You don’t need to understand now.”0\nAfter all, his words were meant to prepare Li Guanqi for the brutal reality of cultivation.1\nHe waved Li Guanqi off and said, “Go back and rest. Tomorrow at seven, head to Heavenly Water Peak for your class. Elder Lan will be your teacher, and she will conduct your first cultivation class. Do not be late.”0\nLi Guanqi bowed and excused himself. 0"

    "content": "By nightfall, a new waist-thick wooden post stood in Li Guanqi’s backyard.0\nLi Guanqi smiled as he gazed at his brand-new wooden pile. Then, he took his stance and began his punching practice with the stone box still on his back.0\nAs he went through the motions, the constant thudding sound of his punches attracted a little girl who was playing nearby. She lay on her stomach on the rooftop, watching Li Guanqi crazedly hit the wooden pile.0\nEvery time he punched, countless wooden shreds would fly into the air. He was constantly ducking and dodging while spinning around the pile.0\nYu Sui’an’s eyes were filled with disbelief. “He’s using the wooden pile as his imaginary enemy! That blind boy is awesome! But what’s that on his back…?”0\nAfter finishing his practice, the sweaty Li Guanqi was ready to rest and bathe. He was looking forward to his first class in the sect. 0\nHe felt that becoming Li Nanting’s disciple had been a good decision. At the very least, Li Nanting looked at him with a pure gaze. Li Guanqi did not sense any malicious intent in the old man.0\nHe put down the sword box and submerged himself in the tub, letting out a contented sigh.0\nThe little girl on the roof slipped into his yard. Then, she sneaked towards his room.1\nLi Guanqi’s ear twitched. He smiled to himself and ignored her.0\nSuddenly, he heard a scream.0\n“Ahhh!”0\nCrash!0\n“Help!”0\nLi Guanqi grabbed his clothes to tie around his waist, then ran out of the door.0\nA small figure flailed beneath the sword box, her tiny hands flailing out.0\nLi Guanqi quickly picked up the sword box with one hand and grabbed the girl with the other. The girl’s face was smudged with dust, but she still had a bao in her mouth—and another one clutched firmly in her hand.0\nHer doll-like features scrunched up into a frown. “I’m hurt! You did this to me!”0\nLi Guanqi laughed at the absurdity of her accusation. She sneaks into my room, touches my sword box without permission, gets herself trapped beneath it, and now I’m the one at fault?0\nLi Guanqi was about to say something, but he saw her face reddening and quickly sat down to inspect her. “Does your chest hurt?”0\nYu Sui’an’s eyes were red. Tears streamed down her face as she nodded.0\nHe quickly comforted her and said, “Don’t worry. Stay here. I’ll put on some clothes and take you to someone now.”0\nAfter rushing into his room and quickly dressing, he lifted her up and dashed out the door. 0\nHe planned to go up the mountain to find his master. Li Guanqi was worried that the sword box might have broken one of her ribs when it fell on her.0\nWorried that she might be afraid, he softened his tone as they ascended the mountain. “What’s your name? I’ve seen you twice now, but I still don’t know.”0\nThe girl, seemingly less distressed, took a hurried bite of a bao to calm herself. Her bell-like voice rang out, “Yu Sui’an. I’m six years old.”2\nLi Guanqi froze for a split second. He hadn’t expected such a nice name.0\nHe eventually found Li Nanting, who was still awake. They comforted the girl for a long time until she finally dozed off in Li Nanting’s arms.0\nLooking at the girl, Li Guanqi asked curiously, “Whose child is she? I’ve seen her twice already.”0\nLi Nanting tucked her in, covered her with a blanket, and gently patted her.0\n“Little Bao isn’t anyone’s child. I brought her here three years ago when I went down the mountain.”0\n“You brought her here?”0\n“That’s right. Three years ago, the northern region of the Daxia Sword Sect’s jurisdiction had a famine. There was a two-year drought, and the farmers could not harvest a single grain of rice. I went there to cast a spell for rain. 0\n“That’s when I saw a little girl crouching. Beside her lay a woman who had starved to death.0\n“I brought her back and bought her a steaming meat bao along the way. To this day, I still remember the way her eyes lit up when she looked at me. She said it was the best thing she’d ever eaten!”0\nLi Guanqi listened quietly. He couldn’t help but think of his own childhood. She hadn’t had it easy either.0\nSo that’s why she always has a bao in her hands…1\nLi Nanting looked at Li Guanqi and said gently, “Why do I get the feeling you resonate with her story?”0\nLi Guanqi smiled bitterly. He looked up at the night sky.0\n“Yeah… I had to use the compensation money for my sister’s death to cremate her—ten strings of coppers. 0\n“When I got home, I personally killed my gambling addict of an uncle. He was the reason my mother fell so ill that she died.0\n“There was a heavy blizzard that day. With my sister’s ashes in my arms, I picked up two mantou buns on the ground. They were stale and rock-hard, but to me, they were the most delicious food in the world. 0\n“That was also the day I went to the crematorium twice.”0\nHis voice was calm, almost detached.0\nLi Nanting looked at him with heartache. He placed a hand on Li Guanqi’s shoulder and said, “It’s all in the past now. From today on, consider me and your seniors your family. Consider Heavenly Lightning Peak your home.”0\nAnd thus, an old man and a young man sat in the yard together, making for a heartwarming sight.4\n***0\nThe next morning, Li Guanqi woke up on a bed he did not recognize, only to realize that he had fallen asleep while leaning on Li Nanting’s shoulder.0\nHe had spent the night in Li Nanting’s room.0\nThere were four hours left until dawn. Li Nanting was sitting on a cushion, quietly cultivating.0\nLi Guanqi tidied up the room, then stepped outside to practice his punches in the backyard. He executed every punch and kick with intense focus, and the air whistled sharply with each movement.0\nUnbeknownst to him, Li Nanting watched from the doorway, nodding in approval.0\nLi Guanqi had been practicing this routine for eight years, allowing him to control every small detail. The constant punching and stepping routines on the wooden poles were also the reason he had perfect control over all his muscles.0\nWhen he finished, he turned around and realized that Li Nanting was behind him, who could not help but give him a thumbs up.0\nThen, Li Nanting personally demonstrated the same routine.0\nHis movements were smooth, like drifting clouds or flowing water. He was in complete control of his strength.0\nLi Guanqi gained a lot of insight from the demonstration.0\nSeeing Li Guanqi deep in thought, Li Nanting smiled. “That’s enough. Let it sink in—you’ll understand the key principles in time. If you don’t hurry to Heavenly Water Peak now, you’ll be late. Lan He hates latecomers.”0\nLi Guanqi blinked. Only then did he realize the sky had already lightened.0\nQuickly freshening up, he turned to excuse himself. “Master, I’m leaving now.”0\nLi Nanting burst into laughter. “Good, good. Hurry up and go.”0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 19 - The Journey of Immortality is Long",
    "content": "On his way to Heavenly Water Peak, Li Guanqi met many disciples who had entered the sect alongside him. The young men and women all wore brand-new sect uniforms, and they were filled with optimism for the future.0\nThey walked in groups of twos and threes, chatting happily as they made their way to class.0\nHeavenly Water Peak was located on the western side of the Daxia Sword Sect. The five main peaks were aligned according to the five elements, while the Wind, Lightning, and Ice peaks stood independently.0\nAs Li Guanqi admired the lively groups around him, two figures suddenly approached and draped their arms around his shoulders.3\n“Hahaha! Guanqi, I can’t believe you chose a Lightning Spirit Root.”0\n“Yeah! And you’ve even got the extremely rare Saint Spirit Root!”0\n“You managed to enter the inner sect directly. What a massive shortcut.”0\nLi Guanqi smiled. He had already asked around about his two friends and knew which peaks they had joined. Lin Dong had entered the inner sect of Heavenly Earth Peak, while Li Sheng’an had joined the outer sect of Heavenly Metal Peak.0\n“Lin Dong, you did well too. An Earth Heavenly Spirit Root? Your future is bright.”0\nThe humble Lin Dong grinned and scratched his head. “My family’s ancestral grave probably has smoke billowing out of it right now. My ancestors racked up some good karma.”0\nLi Sheng’an looked content. Speaking to no one in particular, he said, “With a Mixed Spirit Root, I’m just happy to have made it into the outer sect.”0\nThe three of them continued up Heavenly Water Peak together.0\nAlong the way, they noticed that ninety percent of the disciples in Heavenly Water Peak were women. Many senior sisters gathered on rooftops and other elevated spots to discuss the new arrivals.0\n“Wow, Senior Sister~ Do you see that blind boy carrying the stone on his back? I heard he’s the only disciple the Heavenly Lightning Peak took in this year. And he has the Saint Spirit Root, which is even more impressive than Eldest Senior Brother Wu Bing!”0\nA girl with delicate features faintly smiled as she listened to her junior sister chatter away.0\n“Li Guanqi... I would not have expected someone with such an elegant name to be blind. His talent places him among the best in the Azure Cloud Continent.”4\n“Alright, it’s time for practice. Let’s not gossip anymore.”0\nThe lively crowd gradually gathered at Heavenly Water Peak’s main pavilion.0\nEveryone had a cushion and sat cross-legged. It was not a free seating area, as the cultivation world emphasized order, with the most importance placed on the strongest people.0\nLi Guanqi wanted to sit with the other two, but Li Sheng’an said, “You can’t! Right now, you’re the closed-door disciple of the Heavenly Lightning Peak’s grand elder. That puts you above even the core disciples of other elders. You need to sit at the very front!”0\nLi Guanqi glanced around and noticed the stiff expressions of those nearby. With a resigned sigh, he walked to the front of the hall, where a single cushion waited. The inner sect disciples sat behind him, and the outer sect disciples filled the back rows.1\nThe sect had accepted a total of three hundred and ninety-two new disciples—a particularly large number. Among them were sixty-plus inner sect disciples, including four with Heavenly Spirit Roots.0\nEven possessing a Heavenly Spirit Root didn’t guarantee acceptance as an elder’s direct disciple.0\nLi Guanqi sat cross-legged. In front of him was a low wooden table and a cushion.0\nWhoosh!0\nA gust of wind blew past, and a lady with a stern expression in ice-blue robes appeared behind the desk. This was Lan He, the third elder of the Heavenly Water Peak. She was at the late Golden Core Realm.0\nHer beautiful eyes darkened as they swept over the many empty seats.0\nWith a wave of her hand, the pavilion doors slammed shut. The disciples running outside cried out bitterly. Too afraid to knock on the door, all they could do was stand outside.0\nLan He bent down and gently sat on her cushion.0\n“How could you be late on the first day of class? Stand outside, then! Class begins now!”0\nThe disciples in the pavilion sat up straighter. They hadn’t expected Elder Lan to stay true to her words. She didn’t care whether someone belonged to the inner or outer sect—if they were late, they weren’t getting in.0\nIt left a deep impression on them. The sect meant what it said.0\nThough Lan He was undeniably beautiful, as a teacher, her gaze carried the weight of authority. “I’m sure you all think that embarking on the journey of cultivation is an exciting matter. But today, in this first lesson, I’d like to remind you to never trust easily!”0\nThe disciples exchanged glances, whispering among themselves.0\nAfter a pause, she continued, “When you reach a certain level in cultivation, you’ll come to understand. Those who call themselves your ‘fellow Daoists’ may not be those you can rely on in a crisis. You don’t need to understand now—simply remember it.”1\nLan He was not speaking loudly, yet her words echoed clearly throughout the large pavilion, spanning a hundred zhang.0\nThen, there was a flash in her hand, and a jade slip appeared.0\nShe held it aloft. “I trust you’ve all received your identity jade slips. From today onward, you must carry them with you at all times. They will accompany you for the rest of your lives!”0\nHer tone was solemn. Every disciple who had set foot outside the grounds of the sect understood what it represented.0\n“These jade slips serve many purposes. Within the sect, their most important function is recording your contribution points. They also have location-tracking abilities, allowing you to find other disciples when needed. Additionally, you can use them to check the items in the Treasure Pagoda or watch recorded lectures by various elders.0\n“As such, you must keep your jade slips safe! These functions will naturally unlock once you enter the Qi Refinement Realm.”0\nEveryone took out and studied their jade slips. They hadn’t expected such a small object to have so many uses.0\n“Do you all know where we are right now?” Lan He asked, surprising everyone.0\nSomeone replied, “We’re in the Northern Territory of the Azure Cloud Continent.”0\nThe moment the disciple who replied finished speaking, another teenager with slightly reddened eyes boomed, “Daxia Territory, located in the Northern Territory of the Azure Cloud Continent!”0\nLan He froze for a brief moment, then glanced at the boy with a look of understanding.0\n“So it’s the young master of Ouyang Mountain—Zhong Lin. You’re right. We are in the Daxia Territory of the Azure Cloud Continent. This world is known as the Human World, also called the Lower World. The Human World is divided into six territories, which you will have the chance to explore on your own in the future.0\nShe paused before continuing, “I bring this up because there is something you should know: aside from the Human World and the Immortal World, there is another world. 0\n“The Underworld.”1\nA hush fell over the room.0\nLan He continued, “Across human history, countless cultivators have possessed corpses, thus becoming people who still remember their past lives!”0\nLi Guanqi was shocked. Reincarnators?1\n“The disciplinarians overseeing the Spirit Root Tests have already executed two corpse possessors!”1\nMurmurs of disbelief rippled through the crowd.0\n“There are people who can reincarnate with their memories intact?”3\n“If I didn’t join a sect to learn how to cultivate, I would never have learned about this.” 0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 20 – A Breakthrough In Class Leaves Everyone Shocked",
    "content": "Knock knock knock!0\nLan He rapped her knuckles against the desk a few times. The chatter among the disciples gradually died down.0\n“Alright, that’s enough. I only brought this up so you’d understand what kind of world we live in. We’re all working toward the goal of ascending to immortality! As for reincarnators… even I’ve never met one before. These are people powerful enough to preserve their memories and reincarnate into the next life. You probably won’t find a single one in the entire Daxia Territory.”0\nThe disciples let out a collective sigh of relief. They had thought reincarnators were common.0\nLan He continued, “I mentioned immortals because I wanted to tell you something—the worlds of immortals and humans are not completely separated!”0\nWow!0\nEveryone in the hall jumped at her words, including Li Guanqi. Did she mean that the immortals of the Upper World were connected to the Lower World?0\nLan He paused momentarily, then said gently, “It’s not how you imagine it. Otherwise, why would we need to cultivate to ascend to the Upper World? That’s why our next topic is important—spirit voids and Fate Marks!”0\nLi Guanqi frowned. He had no idea what those were, and neither did the other students.1\n“There’s no need to worry,” Lan He said. “I’ll explain it all.0\n“Humans who reach the Foundation Building Realm before turning eighteen can open their spirit void through a special ceremony and array! 0\n“The spirit void exists inside the Spirit Platform. Various items can form within it, and it appears naturally. Ninety-nine percent of people will have nothing in their spirit voids. Only very, very few people will find something inside. But even then, those items may not be useful—only weapons and magical treasures are truly valuable.”1\nLi Guanqi frowned. “Elder Lan, what’s the use of the items from the spirit void?”0\nLan He smiled and reached out to grasp the air. Suddenly, a blue silk ribbon coiled around all the disciples in the hall like a lasso.0\n“This was the item in my spirit void years ago—a Blue Ribbon. It can be used to attack or restrain people. The items in your spirit void function like a magical treasure and can directly connect to your mind. They’re like weapons forged within your own bodies. If the item complements your abilities, it will greatly enhance your strength.”2\nLan He’s tone became solemn as she continued, “You can only open your spirit void once in your life! Never attempt to force it open a second time!”1\nNow, everyone understood what a spirit void was, though none of them held out much hope.0\nThen, Lan He continued, “When you break through to the Golden Core Realm, you’ll experience a profound sensation, as if someone from the heavens has visited you! If you’re fortunate, an Upper World immortal may grant you a Fate Mark, allowing you to borrow their strength in battle temporarily. As such, if you ever face someone with a Fate Mark, you must be extremely cautious when fighting them!”1\n“Elder Lan, do you have a Fate Mark?” Zhong Lin asked.0\nLan He gave a small smile. A mysterious, milky-white symbol lit up between her brows before vanishing an instant later. 0\n“When Daxia Sword Sect disciples break through to the Golden Core Realm, most of them can receive a Fate Mark. After all, the founder of the Daxia Sword Sect is a powerful cultivator who has ascended to the Upper World!”0\nThe disciples erupted with shock.0\n“Woah! The Daxia Sword Sect has a founder in the Immortal World!”0\n“Good heavens! Other sects probably don’t have this, right?”0\n“The founder…? How many years ago was this person born?!”0\n“Joining the Daxia Sword Sect is the luckiest that’s ever happened to me.”0\nAll the new disciples of the Daxia Sword Sect swelled with pride. They were proud to be part of such a special sect.0\nOnce the conversations died down, Lan He said, “Alright, that was just a brief introduction. Now, we shall begin the first lesson in cultivation, which is about the Body Tempering Realm!”0\nThere was no response.0\nMost of the disciples here were normal people from peasant backgrounds, so they did not even know what body tempering was. 0\nLan He explained the concept, and they gradually understood.0\nShe then handed out a scripture containing the sutra and training method for the Body Tempering Realm. 0\n“It takes anywhere from one to three years to achieve a perfectly tempered body. For example… Li Guanqi.”0\nLi Guanqi rubbed his nose sheepishly.0\nLan He pointed to a five-hundred-jin stone barbell that had been prepared for the lesson and smiled. “Come, Guanqi, show everyone how you can lift this with one hand.”0\nSince she had called him out so directly, Li Guanqi had no choice but to comply.0\nThe barbell consisted of five massive stones threaded together by a steel bar.0\nAll eyes were on Li Guanqi as he walked over. While everyone had recognized his talent from day one, some were skeptical due to his slim, weak-looking frame.0\n“That barbell is at least a hundred jin!” someone muttered. “Can his tiny body really lift it? He’s not even as muscular as me!”0\n“Yeah, can he? He’d better not get crushed to death by that thing.”0\nThere was a twinkle in Zhong Lin’s eye. He was also at the peak of the Body Tempering Realm and estimated that he could pick up three hundred jin at most.0\nThis was where Li Guanqi made a small mistake. He did not know how many stones Lan He wanted him to lift.0\nStanding in front of the barbell, he shrugged and wrapped his right hand around the bar in the center.0\nHoo!0\nThe crowd sucked in a sharp breath.0\nWith ease, Li Guanqi hoisted the barbell above his head. He even gave it a casual wave before turning to ask, “Elder Lan, like this?”0\nLan He’s eyes widened.0\n“Did he just lift five hundred jin like it was nothing?!”0\n“He even waved it around! How strong is his Body Tempering Realm physique?!”0\nLan He coughed, and her expression stiffened. “Uh, that’ll do. You may sit down.”0\nLi Guanqi set the barbell down with a heavy thud. Even though the disciples were seated on cushions, they could still feel the tremor beneath them.0\nZhong Lin was in disbelief. He moved it so effortlessly that his shoulders did not even budge! What technique did he use to achieve such terrifying strength?!0\nLan He distributed another sutra—the one for the Qi Refinement Realm—and instructed them to keep it safe for now.0\nLi Guanqi read through it with his heart’s eye, then adjusted his posture to match the recommended meditation position.0\nThree breaths later, his breathing fell into a steady rhythm.0\nLan He didn’t pay him much attention at first. She continued instructing the other inner sect disciples at the Body Tempering Realm. 0\n“Being able to guide the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth into your body is the most crucial cultivation step. Follow the sutra and feel the qi. Find the energy in the qi that matches your spirit root, then guide it into your body using qi absorption. Finally, when it stabilizes in your dantian and forms a whirlpool, you achieve a breakthrough and enter the Qi Refinement Realm.0\n“The most difficult part is sensing the qi. Those with purer spirit roots will have an easier time, but even for them, it’s a struggle to guide it. Even someone with a Heavenly Spirit Root may take anywhere from three days to a few months. That’s why we must be patient and work hard—”0\nBuzz! A mysterious ripple radiated from Li Guanqi, spreading across the entire pavilion.0\n“Uh… Li Guanqi?!”0\nLan He’s face paled. Her Blue Ribbon appeared and shot out, cordoning off a ten-zhang radius around him. Then, she threw down a circular array tray on the ground. It was embedded with six spirit stones the size of a palm.0\nThere was a ray of spirit light and the space around him became thick with spirit qi, which surrounded him like a veil of smoke.0\nAs he inhaled, the white smoke entered his nostrils.0\nBoom!0\nThe sound of an explosion echoed from within him. Black impurities flowed out of countless pores in his skin, clinging to his skin like mud.0\nLi Guanqi opened his eyes, unsure what just happened. The first thing he saw was the shock in Lan He’s eyes.0\nLi Guanqi had achieved a breakthrough, reaching the first level of the Qi Refinement Realm in his first class!0\nThe first level!0\nLan He was a prodigy with a Heavenly Water Spirit Root, and even she had needed two and a half days to break through.0\n“Some people are just born gifted…”1\nLan He was not alone in her shock. The other disciples turned pale.0\nJealousy flashed in their eyes for a moment, but in the end, they could only sigh.0\n 0\n 0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 21 - Top Talent, Successful Qi Absorption!",
    "content": "When Li Guanqi opened his eyes, he found Lan He and the other disciples in the hall staring at him. Their gazes carried an unmistakable sense of shock—almost as if they were looking at a monster.0\nHe knew exactly why, so he remained calm.0\nLi Guanqi had just successfully absorbed some qi and broken through to the first level of the Qi Refinement Realm. It was nothing worth making a fuss over. 0\nHe had simply followed the Qi Absorption Sutra. Soon after, he entered a profound and mysterious state. He felt as if he were standing between the heavens and the earth, surrounded by many colorful lights. Only the purple lights were drawn toward him, and they merged into his body.  2\nHe felt quite comfortable. However, there were unbearably sticky impurities on his skin, which also emitted an extremely foul stench.0\nLan He smiled slightly and said softly, “These are just impurities. As you continue on the path of cultivation, you will gradually expel them.0\n“You should go clean up. Meanwhile, the others can take a look at the Body Tempering and the Qi Absorption Sutras.0\n“If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.”  0\nInitially, Li Guanqi felt it was inappropriate to leave in the middle of his very first lesson, but the stench was rather unbearable.0\nHe apologized to Lan He, then headed towards the Heavenly Lightning Peak.  0\nAt the foot of the peak, he spotted an old man sitting cross-legged in meditation.  0\nLi Nanting sensed his arrival and opened his eyes with shock. “You little rascal, did you just break through to the Qi Refinement Realm?! Weren’t you in class? How did you break through so suddenly?”0\nLi Guanqi scratched his head in embarrassment. “I broke through during the lesson… and ended up like this.”0\nLi Nanting burst into laughter as he looked at the dirtied Li Guanqi. “Hahaha! As expected of my disciple! That’s amazing!0\n“In the entire history of the Daxia Sword Sect, no one had ever broken through during their very first lesson!0\n“Come, I’ll take you back.”0\nWith that, Li Nanting grabbed Li Guanqi and soared into the sky. Along the way, they passed by many disciples of Heavenly Lightning Peak who were in the midst of training.0\nThey paused momentarily in surprise when they saw Li Guanqi covered in black filth.0\nGu Ran lowered her sword and nudged the tall disciple beside her. She whispered, “Am I seeing things? Didn’t Junior Brother Li attend his first Heavenly Water Peak lesson today? How did he… break through already?”0\nThe tall disciple was just as baffled. He muttered, “Junior Brother Li’s talent is simply too monstrous.”0\n“Isn’t the first lesson just Elder Lan explaining the basics of cultivation?”0\nBefore long, the news spread like wildfire. Li Guanqi, the new disciple of Heavenly Lightning Peak, had broken through to the first level of the Qi Refinement Realm during his very first class.  0\nAt this point, calling him a genius was no longer enough. This was a true prodigy.0\nMeanwhile, the other newly admitted disciples struggled at the Body Tempering Realm, striving to lift a hundred-jin stone mill with one hand.0\nAfter bathing, Li Guanqi headed back to his room, finally feeling refreshed. 0\nDuring his bath, he had to change the water three times and scrub his skin until it turned red. 0\nHe stepped out of his room and noticed his master had not left. There were several jade bottles and spirit stones on the table.0\nLi Nanting’s eyes showed a hint of pride as he gestured for Li Guanqi to sit beside him. Without hesitation, Li Guanqi walked over and took a seat.0\nLi Nanting looked at him with satisfaction and asked, “Did Lan He explain what spirit voids and Fate Marks were?”0\nLi Guanqi nodded. 0\nLi Nanting looked up at the sky and said softly, “The spirit void is determined at birth. Whether one has it or not makes no difference—it won’t affect your path of cultivation.0\n“Since you’ve already taken your first step, I will explain the next stages of cultivation to you.”0\nLi Guanqi’s expression turned serious, and he unconsciously straightened his back.  0\n“The Qi Refinement Realm consists of ten levels. The first three temper the internal organs, the middle three refine the meridians, and the last three cultivate the spirit before finishing with the peak level.0\n“The goal is to allow your body to adapt to spirit power and to prepare for the initial emergence of divine consciousness.0\n“Right now, do you feel some swelling in your Spirit Platform?”0\nLi Guanqi nodded. Ever since his breakthrough at Heavenly Water Peak, he had felt an unusual sensation between his brows, as if something had taken shape there.0\nLi Nanting chuckled. “Don’t worry. That is an early sign of your sea of consciousness, similar to your dantian.0\n“At this stage, your dantian is still unstable. You must not rush recklessly into things. Think of it like a newborn baby—extremely fragile. When cultivating, you must clear your mind completely and focus on meditation.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded solemnly, taking the lesson to heart.0\n“Once you reach the ninth level, you can attempt to break through to the Foundation Building Realm. Given your exceptional talent, it would be best to cultivate until you reach the tenth level, the level of perfection, before attempting the breakthrough.0\n“With your talent and the assistance of a Foundation Building Pill, I have no qualms about your success.0\n“You now have five hundred contribution points. You should go to Heavenly Sword Peak’s Scripture Pavilion as soon as possible to find a suitable cultivation technique.”  0\nHe handed Li Guanqi a cloth pouch. “Take this storage bag.” 0\nLi Guanqi examined it curiously. “What does a storage bag do? It’s so small. It doesn’t look like it can hold much.”0\n“Hahahaha. Try using your divine consciousness within your Spirit Platform to interact with it. Focus your mind and imagine your divine consciousness as a silver thread.”  0\nLi Guanqi stopped using his heart’s eye and instantly felt the presence of his divine consciousness in his sea of consciousness.0\nIt was faint, like mist, barely filling the bottom of a large water jar. He concentrated on nudging his divine consciousness and managed to move it successfully!0\nThis divine consciousness was like a pair of eyes, allowing him to perceive the outside world with startling clarity.0\n“It’s not just black and white…” Li Guanqi said. His eyes turned moist, and tears streamed down his face uncontrollably. His lips trembled as he choked out, “I… I can see colors!”  1\nLi Nanting patted his back reassuringly, helping him calm down.  0\nHis divine consciousness touched the storage bag, revealing a space as vast as ten zhang!0\nThe elder chuckled. “Try storing the items on the table inside the storage bag.”  0\nWhoosh!0\nWith a single thought, Li Guanqi watched as everything on the table vanished into the bag. Grinning, he put the storage bag away.0\nThen, Li Nanting shared many things about the cultivation world with Li Guanqi. Each revelation was fascinating, broadening Li Guanqi’s horizons.  0\nFor instance, ghosts truly existed. Some lacked three souls and seven spirits[1], while others were filled with deep resentment and unable to enter reincarnation.  0\nAdditionally, many plants and minerals in the world could become supernatural beings upon gaining sentience. Humans pursued immortality through cultivation, while these plant beings yearned to take human form through cultivation.0\nLi Guanqi hadn’t expected he would soon witness such things with his own eyes.1\nThat day, the two of them sat in the courtyard and talked for a long time. Li Nanting patiently explained the various obstacles one might encounter in cultivation. He also advised Li Guanqi to continue practicing his martial arts twice daily and not neglect them because of his cultivation.1\nUpon further contemplation, Li Nanting realized that Li Guanqi's martial techniques were more than simple punches and kicks. Every movement carried profound intricacies, allowing for precise control over the body.0\nHe even considered asking Li Guanqi for permission to teach his martial arts techniques to all the disciples of Heavenly Lightning Peak.1\n1. The three souls and seven spirits is a Chinese concept that describes the multiple aspects of the human soul. The three heavenly souls are more spiritual and leave the body after death. The three souls are also linked to higher consciousness and reincarnation. The seven earthly spirits are more material and remain with the body after death. They are also linked to the seven emotions: joy, anger, grief, fear, love, hatred, and desire. ☜1"

    "content": "Early the next morning, Li Guanqi was sound asleep in his master’s courtyard when a sharp tolling bell jolted him awake.0\nHe got up and noticed that his master was already waiting outside the door.0\nLi Nanting’s expression was solemn. “Get up quickly. We’re heading to the Heavenly Sword Peak’s plaza.” 0\nThough bewildered, Li Guanqi quickly gathered his belongings and followed his master down the mountain. Along the way, he noticed that all the sect’s disciples were making their way toward the Heavenly Sword Peak.  0\nEvery single disciple was heading there at this moment.  0\nLi Guanqi asked curiously, “Master, what’s going on? What’s that ringing mean?” 0\nLi Nanting explained with a heavy expression, ”That was the Daxia Sword Sect’s warning bell. It rarely rings, but when it does, all disciples within the sect must immediately gather at the Heavenly Sword Peak Plaza. It means that a disciple has broken the sect’s rules.”0\nLi Guanqi’s heart trembled. What kind of violation could warrant such a drastic response?  0\nHe didn’t dare ask further and simply followed. Many disciples they passed along the way paused to bow respectfully to Li Nanting, while others greeted Li Guanqi with warm smiles.0\nIn return, Li Guanqi politely smiled and greeted them back.0\nLi Nanting felt they were wasting too much time. He grabbed Li Guanqi and soared into the sky, heading straight for Heavenly Sword Peak.0\nWhen they landed, the plaza was already packed with thousands of sect disciples.  0\nThe ones standing at the forefront appeared to be in their mid-twenties, with extremely powerful auras.0\nLi Guanqi previously wouldn’t have sensed anything, as he had yet to enter the Qi Refinement Realm. Now, he could vaguely feel the immense aura emanating from these people. He was utterly shocked.0\nAre all of these seniors at the Foundation Building Realm? How powerful!0\nAside from the newly admitted disciples, the plaza was densely packed with thousands of people.0\nThe newcomers all looked confused, while the senior disciples bore grave expressions.  0\nEven those who had been in the sect for years had never heard the warning bell toll before.0\nWhoosh!0\nSect Master Lu Kangnian appeared in the sky.  0\nBehind him, a figure hung mid-air, bound at the limbs by four earthen-yellow shackles.0\nThe figure was a youth, seemingly seventeen or eighteen. He glared viciously at Lu Kangnian.  0\nLu Kangnian’s expression was grim. With a single downward press of his palm, the entire plaza fell completely silent.  0\nEveryone felt like a heavy weight had been placed on their hearts.  0\nLi Guanqi noticed that nearly all the elders of the various peaks he had seen during his initiation were standing behind Lu Kangnian.  0\nThe ones at the front were elders he had never seen before.  0\nAmong them, a middle-aged-looking man with an extremely dark expression caught his eye. Judging by his attire, he was most likely the peak master of Heavenly Metal Peak.0\nLu Kangnian’s icy voice rang out, “Tu Kui, kneel!”0\nThe man shuddered but fell to his knees without complaint before the gathered disciples.0\nA whip appeared in Lu Kangnian’s hands. It was pitch black and covered in sharp barbs.  0\nThe whip lashed out with a flick of his wrist, striking Tu Kui’s back.0\nCrack!0\nThe sharp sound echoed across the plaza, and Tu Kui’s white robe was instantly torn apart. His back was soaked in blood within moments.  0\nCrack! Crack! Crack!0\nThe whip lashed down again and again, mercilessly cutting into Tu Kui’s flesh.  0\nHe did not utter a single sound from start to finish, silently enduring the punishment.  0\nHis face was pale, and sweat beads dripped onto the stone pavement.  0\nEveryone trembled inwardly. No one knew what had happened, but they were all stunned by Lu Kangnian’s seething fury.0\nFinally, Lu Kangnian lowered the whip and glared at the kneeling man. His bloodshot eyes burned with rage.0\n“Tu Kui! I appointed you as the Heavenly Metal Peak Master, and this is how you discipline your disciples?! 0\n“What an outstanding disciple you’ve raised! The Heavenly Metal Peak is truly exemplary!0\n“A so-called disciple of an immortal sect, acting with such unchecked arrogance!0\n“Had that eighty-year-old woman not taken twelve days to make her way to the foot of our sect, I wouldn’t have even known of the vile acts your disciple committed in the outside world!0\n“I had no idea our Daxia Sword Sect had bred such a beast!”  0\nTu Kui remained silent. He knew there was nothing to argue—his disciple’s crime was beyond redemption.0\nAt that moment, the bound youth sneered ferociously and yelled, “That woman should have been honored that I took a liking to her!0\n“Why should I be punished? I even gave her one hundred taels of silver! She’s the one who took advantage of the situation!”0\nLu Kangnian reached out and gripped the youth’s neck, pulling him closer.0\nHis stern face loomed close. “Even now, you feel no remorse? You think you’re in the right?0\n“You are unworthy of being a disciple of an immortal sect!”0\nThe youth’s face turned red from the chokehold, but his defiant eyes showed no hint of regret.0\nLu Kangnian’s right palm struck the youth’s abdomen.  0\nThump!0\nA visible strand of qi burst from the youth’s dantian, dissipating into the air.0\nBlood spurted from the youth’s mouth as he coughed. “Agh! Ahhh!”0\nThe youth, a prodigy who had reached the Foundation Building Realm at twenty, had had his dantian crippled in an instant.0\nThe gathered disciples were frozen with fear, their breaths shallow and uneven.0\nLu Kangnian was still seething with rage. He released the binding spell, sending the youth crashing to the ground. 0\n“That young woman was to be married in three days. She begged you for mercy.0\n“And yet, you still forced yourself upon her. You even struck down her grandmother.0\n“The young lady, driven to despair and ashamed to face her future husband, hanged herself after you left.0\n“You call yourself a disciple of an immortal sect?0\n“My Daxia Sword Sect is ashamed.0\n“Ashamed!”0\nClang!0\nA longsword appeared in Lu Kangnian’s hands, and he raised it high. 0\nFear flashed in the youth’s eyes. With his dantian crippled, he had only lost his path to immortality. But now, Lu Kangnian was going to kill him.0\nHe’d been lying down in extreme agony, but he endured it and crawled forward.0\nThump! Thump! Thump! The youth frantically kowtowed, slamming his head against the ground, blood seeping from the impact.0\n“Sect Master! I know I was wrong!0\n“I’ll go apologize to the old woman! I’ll compensate them with silver!0\n“I’ll leave the sect! I’ll serve their family for the rest of my life!”  0\nThump!0\n“I’m wrong. I truly know I’m wrong. Spare me, please spare me..”0\nThump thump!0\n“I genuinely know my mistake. You see, if I’m dead, there won’t be anyone left to take care of the elderly grandmother.0\n“If you spare me, I’ll go down to the mountain now and take care of them till they pass away from old age.0\n“I’m just a cripple now. Spare me, please!”0\nThe entire plaza was silent, save for the youth’s desperate pleas.0\nEven the new disciples now understood the whole story.0\nThey understood the grandmother’s situation, but many also felt that the youth’s attitude was extremely sincere.0\nAt this moment, Li Nanting turned to Li Guanqi and asked solemnly, “What do you think?”0\nLi Guanqi’s voice was cold. “He must die.” 0\nIndeed, the youth’s pleas had done little to appease Lu Kangnian. 0\nHe brought his sword down. 0\nThe sword flashed like lightning, reducing the youth to a human stick. Blood sprayed three feet high, and the youth’s screams were abruptly cut short.  0\nLu Kangnian swept his icy gaze across the disciples. 0\n“I will not tolerate another violation of the sect’s rules! If you do not understand them, read your identity jade slip thoroughly and engrave them into your heart!0\n“Tu Kui, as the Peak Master of the Heavenly Metal Peak, you have failed in your duty. You are removed from your position, effective immediately!0\n“Meng Linhai will take over as Peak Master!0\n“A master cannot escape responsibility for a disciple’s crimes! You will personally take your disciple’s corpse and offer an explanation to that elderly woman!”0\nTu Kui got up unsteadily, his face pale. He bowed deeply without any intention of talking back.0\n“Tu Kui accepts his punishment.”0\nLu Kangnian flicked his sleeve, snorted coldly, and disappeared from sight.0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 23 - This Person Must Die, to put Hearts at Peace",
    "content": "This incident came and went quickly, but its impact lingered for a long time.  0\nOnce the disciples dispersed, nearly everyone began memorizing the sect’s rules.0\nOn the way back to Heavenly Lightning Peak, Li Nanting asked softly, “Why did you think that person had to die? Didn’t many disciples believe that he showed genuine remorse?0\n“And considering the old woman’s situation, if we had done as that disciple suggested, perhaps it wouldn’t have been so bad.”0\nLi Guanqi shook his head. Even before opening his heart’s eye, he had long understood that many people could not withstand the test of human nature.0\nAs a child, he had already witnessed the ugliest aspects of humanity.0\nHe calmly shared his perspective on the matter, saying, \"That disciple didn’t think he did anything wrong. He believed that he had a noble status since he was from an immortal sect.0\n“He thought that taking a liking to that girl was her good fortune. He even left behind a hundred taels of silver, which was enough to ensure a lifetime of comfort for the common folk below the mountain. So, in his mind, he did nothing wrong.”  0\nLi Nanting was intrigued. “Go on.”  0\nLi Guanqi hesitated briefly before continuing, “What he did was against that girl’s will. To her, that disciple of the Daxia Sword Sect was no different from a ruthless bandit. She was about to be married, but now she had lost her purity. In her heart, that disciple was simply evil.0\n“As for her grandmother, how could she ever accept the man who ruined her granddaughter’s life, even if he served her for ‘atonement’? Moreover, with that disciple’s temperament, he surely would’ve sought revenge and silenced the witnesses if we’d let him go today!”  0\nA sharp glint flashed in Li Nanting’s eyes. “Indeed! That old woman would’ve probably been in danger if we had let that disciple go.”0\nLi Guanqi continued, “Even if we planted a curse in his heart to prevent him from doing evil and forced him to serve the old woman like a slave, she would still have to see her enemy daily. How could she ever be at peace?0\n“That is why I said that he had to die! 0\n“He also had to serve as a warning. The rules and traditions of the Daxia Sword Sect must not be broken. The sect master even punished the peak master of Heavenly Metal Peak, which is a powerful deterrent to the other disciples.”0\nLi Nanting smiled in satisfaction.0\nIt seemed like Li Guanqi was not only exceptionally talented but also had sound judgment. He had analyzed the situation from every perspective.0\nLi Nanting had also learned about Li Guanqi’s childhood from their conversation the previous day. It made him feel a deep sense of compassion for Li Guanqi. Also, he was mature for his age.0\nBut that very maturity only made Li Nanting feel even more sorrowful—because it meant Li Guanqi had endured even more hardship.0\nLi Nanting placed a hand on Li Guanqi’s wrist. Surprised, he said, “You just reached the first level of the Qi Refinement Realm, yet it’s already this stable?”  0\nLi Guanqi scratched his head, feeling a little embarrassed. “Master, I was actually about to ask you about this. Why is the qi whirlpool in my dantian only the size of a thumb?”0\nLi Nanting was at a loss for words.0\nWhen ordinary people break through to the first level, they have just started the qi absorption process. Li Guanqi had just initiated his qi absorption, but the qi whirlpool in his dantian had already stabilized.0\nAt this rate, it wouldn’t take long before he filled his dantian completely and broke through to the second level.0\nLi Nanting took a deep breath and explained softly, “This is the foundation of your dantian! It might just be the size of a thumb now, but it will be the foundation for your cultivation. As you refine and fill it with vital force, your dantian will naturally expand.0\n“Your dantian.. wait, what is this?!”0\nThis time, Li Nanting was genuinely shocked. He hadn’t paid much attention to Li Guanqi’s dantian earlier, as he’d been focused on the qi whirlpool. But now, he realized that Li Guanqi’s dantian was the size of a water tank.0\nLi Guanqi panicked slightly, thinking he might have cultivated incorrectly. “Master, what’s wrong? Did I do something wrong?”  0\nLi Nanting took several deep breaths before calming down.0\nHe looked at Li Guanqi and asked, “You don’t feel any discomfort in your dantian, do you?”0\nHe shook his head, and Li Nanting felt reassured. Perhaps Li Guanqi had been born with an exceptionally large dantian. If so, not only was his cultivation speed astonishingly fast, but even his dantian was far larger than most.0\nLi Nanting made a silent vow in his heart. The resources needed for his disciple’s cultivation would surely be astronomical. However, he would never let the boy worry about such things. 0\nA warm smile appeared on Li Nanting’s face as he said gently, “It’s fine. It’s actually very good!0\n“Since you have had a successful qi absorption and your dantian’s core is already refined, your next step is to visit the Scripture Pavilion on the Heavenly Pillar Peak and choose a cultivation technique that suits you. Only with a proper cultivation technique can you actively absorb the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth, and the purer spirit qi from spirit stones.  0\n“That way, you can absorb the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth and convert it into your own usable vital force.”0\nAs they ascended the mountain, Li Nanting continued explaining the details of cultivation. He spoke about the changes that would occur when breaking through to the second and third levels of Qi Refinement. 0\nWith each breakthrough, the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth cleansed the cultivator’s bones and marrow and eliminated some impurities.0\nWhen they returned to the courtyard, Li Guanqi packed up briefly before heading to the Heavenly Pillar Peak.  0\nThe Heavenly Pillar Peak was the tallest mountain within a ten-li radius of the Daxia Sword Sect. Its unique shape resembled a towering dragon reaching toward the heavens, standing over five hundred zhang tall. As such, it was known as the Heavenly Pillar Peak.0\nLi Guanqi had learned some information about the Heavenly Pillar Peak through the jade slip.0\nThe sect’s Artifact Hall, Alchemy Tower, Scripture Pavilion, Mission Pavilion, and other important locations were all situated there. These places were spread throughout the mountain, from the base to the summit.0\nTraversing the peak daily was enough to temper one’s body. However, once Li Guanqi reached the Foundation Building Realm, he would be able to fly on his sword, making travel far easier.0\nAs he walked toward the Heavenly Pillar Peak, Li Guanqi pondered his master’s teachings. Before he knew it, he had arrived at the mountain’s base.0\nA sect disciple stopped him with a friendly smile. “Please show your identification jade slip.”0\nLi Guanqi smiled slightly and handed it over. “Li Guanqi, disciple of Heavenly Lightning Peak. Thank you.”0\nUpon confirming his identity, the disciple’s expression changed instantly. Smiling, he said, “Ah, so it’s Junior Brother Li. You’ve been quite the talk of the sect lately. Where are you headed?”0\nLi Guanqi, unused to such enthusiasm, quickly replied, “Senior Brother, I’m heading to the Scripture Pavilion. How do I get there?”0\n“Haha, looking for a cultivation technique, huh? The lightning-based techniques are on the south side of the first floor. You can check there.”0\nLi Guanqi thanked him and was about to start climbing when the disciple called him back and pointed to several platforms behind him. “If you’re going to the summit, why not use the transport array?”0\nLi Guanqi hesitated. There’s quite a lot of interesting things in this sect.0\nHe was curious as he had not taken a transport array before. He didn’t reject the offer, stepping onto the transport array towards the Scripture Pavilion.0\nThe senior held out his hand. “That’ll be five contribution points. Can Junior Brother hand over his jade slip for payment?”0\nLi Guanqi’s face darkened, and he stepped off the array. “Thank you for the offer, Senior Brother, but I’ll use the transport array when I’m richer. I’m poor now and can’t afford these five contribution points. I will definitely use it next time.”1\nLi Guanqi proceeded to leave, while the senior didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.1\nCarrying the five-hundred-jin sword coffin on his back, Li Guanqi dashed toward the peak.0\nAt the summit, an old man rocking in a chair and sipping wine chuckled.0\n“Interesting little fellow, haha.”0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 24 - The Lame Man, the Guardian of the Pavilion ",
    "content": "Along the way, Li Guanqi encountered many fellow disciples. Groups of people had gathered in several places, and some had even set up small stalls along the path of Heavenly Pillar Peak.0\nThe items on the stalls were diverse and peculiar—there was a little of everything.0\nHalfway up the mountain, he saw the bustling Mission Pavilion. All disciples would receive their missions here in the future.1\nThe rewards for these missions varied. Some were spirit stones, while others were items or elixirs. More importantly, most missions rewarded contribution points.  0\nThese points were exchangeable for lower-grade spirit stones at a rate of ten to one. They also served as the sect’s internal currency, allowing disciples to purchase a wide range of goods.0\nAs he continued, he saw the imposing Artifact Hall and the towering Alchemy Tower, but he didn’t stop along the way. He had a clear purpose for this trip—reaching the Scripture Pavilion as soon as possible to select a suitable cultivation technique.0\nHalf an hour later, Li Guanqi finally reached the mountaintop, drenched in sweat.0\nThe path had been packed with people, yet to his surprise, only a handful was present at the precious Scripture Pavilion.0\nUpon reaching the summit, he saw a massive platform and a three-story ancient hall.0\nA ten-zhang-high towering rosewood door gave off a sense of immense weight. Above it, a blue plaque bore bold, golden calligraphy: Scripture Pavilion.0\nThe brushstrokes were as sharp as swords, exuding an eerie chill even through the plaque.0\nSwish! Swish!0\nThe rhythmic sound of sweeping filled the air.0\nA middle-aged man with disheveled hair was slowly sweeping away the dust from the mountain, leaning on a crutch.7\nBefore long, he approached Li Guanqi but acted as though he hadn’t noticed him.0\nLi Guanqi cupped his fists and bowed slightly in greeting—only for the man’s broom to sweep across the top of his foot.0\nThe man straightened his posture and shouted angrily, “Are you blind? Can’t you see I’m sweeping here?”0\nLi Guanqi took half a step back. Without any change in emotion, he replied, “Yes, I am blind.”1\nThe man looked up at Li Guanqi’s face. His prominent nose and thin lips made him look strikingly handsome despite the black cloth covering his eyes.0\nFor a moment, the man hesitated. He hadn’t expected the boy to actually be blind.  0\nHe felt like he had gone overboard with his words but was unwilling to back down. “You’re already blind, so why bother covering it? Are you afraid people will stare? I’m lame, and I don’t cover my leg.”  0\nLi Guanqi was momentarily stunned. To his own surprise, he found himself agreeing with the man’s words.0\nSlowly, he removed the black cloth, revealing his pure white eyes. Then, he looked directly at the man and smiled.0\nA chill ran down the man’s spine under that gaze. He quickly stepped aside and muttered as he walked away, “Scary! That scared me.”0\nStill, he had to admit that Li Guanqi’s eyes were truly beautiful. They were a pair of fox-like, peach-blossom eyes. If not for their eerie whiteness, they might have bewitched countless women.  1\nA subtle shift had occurred in Li Guanqi’s mindset. He felt that the lame man’s words carried truth, though they were spoken crudely.0\nAfter a moment of silence, Li Guanqi bowed toward the man’s retreating figure. “Thank you for your guidance, Senior.” 0\nThe man acted as though he hadn’t heard, muttering under his breath, “Senior, my ass. I’m just a cripple. Have you read too many of those legends? Do you think a cleaner like me could be some hidden master? Not only are you blind, but your brain doesn’t seem too sharp either.”4\nLi Guanqi merely chuckled, indifferent to whether the man was truly a senior or not. He was simply grateful for those offhand remarks, which had untangled a small knot in his heart.0\nSomeone nearby saw the man leave and let out a relieved sigh. “That old Gao… always so ill-tempered and eccentric!”0\nLi Guanqi’s ears twitched. He turned toward the disciple and asked softly, “Senior Brother, do you know who that man is?”0\n“Ah!”0\nThe young man let out a startled cry before hurriedly bowing in apology. “Sorry! I didn’t mean to laugh at you. I was just surprised.”0\nLi Guanqi smiled as he shrugged. “It’s alright, Senior Brother is too courteous.”0\nThe young man smiled back. Then, noticing Li Guanqi’s sect robes, he immediately understood. “You’re a disciple of Heavenly Lightning Peak—Li Guanqi, right?”0\nSeeing that Li Guanqi didn’t deny it, the young man continued, “That man’s name is Gao Qiwen. He used to be… Ah, forget it. Just don’t provoke him. If you do, he’ll chase you around the sect for three whole laps!”0\nAfter the disciple left, Li Guanqi shook his head, not thinking further about the lame man. If I had known, I would’ve cursed him back. 0\nI thought he was some hidden master in the sect. I got scolded for nothing and didn’t even talk back. Such a loss! Hmm… should I break his broom?7\nLost in these thoughts, he soon arrived at the Scripture Pavilion’s entrance. Just as he was about to step inside, he felt someone grab his sword coffin from behind. 0\nLi Guanqi reacted instinctively and lashed out with a powerful right kick.0\nSmack! A crisp impact rang out.0\nLi Guanqi felt as though the sole of his foot had been struck by a heavy hammer, forcing it downward.0\nEnduring the sharp pain, he twisted his body midair, using his waist as a pivot. He swung down his left leg like a giant axe.0\nAs he spun, he finally caught a clear glimpse of his attacker—an elderly man with white hair but youthful features who was watching him with a smile.0\nBut Li Guanqi did not retract his attack. He brought his leg down with even greater force.0\nThump!0\nWith just a casual raise of his right hand, the old man effortlessly neutralized Li Guanqi’s attack and sent him flying a few meters away.0\nLi Guanqi twisted midair, landed with one hand, and executed a smooth backflip to stabilize himself.0\nThe old man wore a simple white robe. He was slightly plump, with small eyes, a bulbous nose, and a yellowed wine gourd hanging from his waist. The wine seemed quite aged.0\nHe smiled at Li Guanqi without saying a word, his hands clasped behind his back.0\nLi Guanqi pointed at the old man’s wrinkled robe and remarked softly, “Now, that’s the kind of clothing that’s truly comfortable.”0\nThe old man’s eyes lit up. He immediately hugged Li Guanqi. “Kid, you too?” 0\nLi Guanqi rubbed his nose and replied, “When I was a beggar, I found wrinkled clothes to be the softest. Unfortunately, I only ever had one such set.”0\nHe glanced at his brand-new sect robes and muttered, “It’ll take ages to wear this down to that state.”0\nThe old man blinked and chuckled. “Then why not just wear your own clothes?0\n“Kid, your physical foundation is solid! Even I’m curious how you trained to this level. My name is Ling Daoyan. You can just call me Old Ling.”0\nLi Guanqi bowed respectfully. “Disciple Li Guanqi greets Old Ling.” 0\nLing Daoyan had clearly taken a liking to Li Guanqi. That kick earlier had been full force, showing impressive strength. He chuckled. “So you’re the one who recently awakened a Saint Spirit Root? You’re making waves in the sect!”0\nLi Guanqi shrugged. “I don’t care for fame. The higher they lift me up, the harder I’ll fall.”0\nLing Daoyan nodded approvingly. He felt Li Guanqi was very mature.0\nHe pointed at the stairs. “Don’t waste time on the first floor. Lu Kangnian already spoke to me. I’m making an exception and granting you access to the third floor!”0\nLi Guanqi’s face lit up with joy. He bowed in gratitude, then hurried upstairs.0\nLing Daoyan leaned back in his rocking chair, closed his eyes, and smiled. “The Daxia Sword Sect has found a good seedling.”3"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 25 - Gambler Ye Feng, King Spirit Root ",
    "content": "As Li Guanqi stepped into the Scripture Pavilion, he couldn’t help but feel a bit puzzled.  0\nWhy was such a powerful hidden expert sitting so blatantly at the entrance of the Scripture Pavilion? On the other hand, the cleaner, whom he had assumed to be an expert in disguise, turned out to be nothing more than an ordinary cripple.  0\nThe Scripture Pavilion had an incredibly high ceiling, and the air was bone-dry, likely due to some method used to protect the cultivation manuals and secret techniques from moisture damage.0\nThe first floor was vast and open, with neatly arranged bookshelves packed densely together. Each shelf was labeled according to the type of cultivation techniques it held.0\nAt the moment, there were only a dozen or so sect disciples scattered around, browsing through the selections.  0\nWhen he ascended to the second floor, he immediately noticed that there were far fewer books there. Only a handful of bookshelves remained, and just two or three disciples were present. Among them was the senior brother who had spoken to him earlier.0\nUpon seeing Li Guanqi, the senior brother enthusiastically waved and smiled. “Junior Brother, there are some excellent lightning-element techniques over here! They are even Upper Yellow Tier techniques, which are very suitable for you.”0\nLi Guanqi smiled in embarrassment and pointed upstairs. “Thank you, Senior Brother, but I’m headed to the third floor.” 0\nThe senior brother’s hand froze in mid-air. He had spent over a year accumulating 1,500 contribution points just to gain access to the second floor. The third floor required a minimum of 3,000 points!  0\nNoticing his disbelief, Li Guanqi quickly explained, “Senior Brother, you misunderstood. I don’t have that many points.” 0\nThe youth’s expression eased, and he chuckled. 0\n“I thought so. Junior Brother, you just joined the sect. There’s no way you’d have enough points to enter the third floor already. The good techniques on the first floor only cost 300 to 500 points, and they’re quite decent. The second floor requires at least 1,000. You should check the southeast corner downstairs for something suitable.”0\nLi Guanqi appreciated his kindness. Since he was being so enthusiastic, Li Guanqi didn’t want to brush him off. Shrugging helplessly, he said, “Sect Master Lu Kangnian made an exception and allowed me to go up and choose.”0\nTheir conversation had already drawn the attention of the nearby disciples.0\nAt Li Guanqi’s words, all eyes turned toward a certain disciple from Heavenly Wood Peak.0\nThe Heavenly Wood Peak disciple was a full-grown man, but he now had teary eyes and was biting his lower lip. He followed Li Guanqi’s departing figure with a deeply resentful gaze.3\nAs soon as Li Guanqi stepped onto the third floor, a shimmering light barrier blocked his path. Above, glowing stones cast a soft radiance, scanning the jade slip at his waist. Once verified, the barrier opened to let him in.0\nThe sight that greeted him on the third floor utterly shocked him.0\nThere were no bookshelves on this floor. Instead, the entire space was empty, with countless glowing motes of spirit light drifting freely in the air.0\nTo his surprise, he was not alone on this floor. A tall and slender young man stood in the middle of the room, his features strikingly handsome. His golden hair was particularly eye-catching.  0\nThis was none other than another disciple who had joined the sect at the same time as him.0\nThe young man had sharp, sword-like eyebrows and deep, captivating eyes. A small mole on the bridge of his nose made his appearance even more unique, giving him a somewhat bewitching charm.  0\nA look of surprise flashed in the young man’s eyes. He hadn’t expected anyone else to be there. 0\nHe slowly approached Li Guanqi and smiled slightly. “Hello, I’m Ye Feng from the Heavenly Metal Peak.”0\nLi Guanqi glanced at the exceptionally good-looking young man and instinctively rubbed his nose. Wow, this guy looks so flashy. He’s probably super popular with the female disciples at Heavenly Water Peak.0\nDespite his thoughts, he returned the smile. “Heavenly Lightning Peak, Li Guanqi.”0\nYe Feng chuckled. “I’ve heard of you. A Saint Spirit Root, huh? I’m truly envious. With my King Spirit Root, I barely caused a stir after you stole the spotlight.”0\nLi Guanqi smiled outwardly but rolled his eyes inwardly.0\nThis guy clearly loved being the center of attention. But because he had tested his Spirit Root after Li Guanqi, no one had paid much attention to him.0\nYe Feng pointed at the floating spirit lights and grinned. “How about a little bet? Let’s see who can grab the highest-tier technique.”0\nLi Guanqi wasn’t sure why Ye Feng suddenly felt the need to compete with him.0\n“Nothing better to do, huh? Sure, why not,” Li Guanqi replied.0\nYe Feng’s eyes lit up with excitement. With a flick of his wrist, he pulled out over a hundred low-tier spirit stones.0\nHe grinned at Li Guanqi. “Compared to your talent, I’m still far behind. But I’ve already started sensing the surrounding spirit qi. I should be able to begin the Qi Absorption by tonight.”0\nLi Guanqi narrowed his eyes. Why does this guy insist on comparing himself with me? Does he not know I reached the first level of Qi Refinement at Heavenly Water Peak?0\nSince Ye Feng was so eager to compete, Li Guanqi decided to play along. He pulled out a similar number of spirit stones from his storage bag and placed them on the ground.0\nHe feigned frustration and sighed. “Ugh, I’m not that talented. I still haven’t sensed any spirit qi. Let’s just bet these hundred spirit stones.”1\nA sly glint flashed in Ye Feng’s eyes. He pretended to hesitate before saying, “Ah, then wouldn’t I be taking advantage of you? Tell you what—I’ll only take half the spirit stones if I win. But if I lose, you can have all of mine.”0\nLi Guanqi acted embarrassed. “How could I possibly agree to that? A bet is a bet—” 0\n“Alright! We’ll do it my way!” Ye Feng cut him off with a decisive wave.0\nLittle did he know, his antics made him look like a complete fool to Li Guanqi.0\nThe method for obtaining the spirit lights was simple—once someone stepped onto the platform, they had 30 minutes to catch as many as they could.0\nThe techniques ranged from the Lower Black to Top Black Tiers.0\nNormally, it would take over a year of completing sect missions just to earn enough points to access this floor.0\nYe Feng extended his hand gracefully. “Would you like to go first?”0\nLi Guanqi hesitated. “Why don’t you go first? I doubt I’ll be able to catch anything.”0\nTo Ye Feng, this was a sign of Li Guanqi’s complete lack of confidence.0\nFeigning reluctance, Ye Feng said, “Alright, I’ll go first. This is mostly about speed.” 0\nHe leaped and landed firmly onto the platform.0\nLi Guanqi smacked his lips. Ye Feng’s body tempering was indeed solid, so it was no wonder he was so self-assured.0\nHowever, he was still curious. Had Ye Feng really not heard about what happened at the Heavenly Water Peak that day?0\nWait… unless… All the disciples were there that day, except those who were late. Could it be that this guy was late on his first day and didn’t even bother entering?0\nDozens of glowing spirit lights of various colors zipped through the air at high speed.0\nYe Feng moved swiftly, his golden hair flowing behind him. He used the surrounding walls as footholds to chase after the spirit lights.0\nYet every time he was about to catch one, the lights would suddenly dart away—it was far trickier than he had expected.0\nIt turned out Li Guanqi’s guess was correct. Ye Feng had no idea Li Guanqi had broken through to the first level of the Qi Refinement Realm. He hadn’t just been late that day—he had completely overslept.1\nAnother disciple had given Ye Feng his Qi Refinement Sutra after class.0"

    "content": "In no time, Ye Feng caught his first spirit light. He frowned, then tossed it aside, clearly dissatisfied with the technique’s tier.0\nThe half-hour passed quickly. He caught two more spirit lights, only to abandon them both. A proud man like him would never settle for a Lower or Middle Black-tier technique.0\nWhoosh!0\nYe Feng reached out to grab a golden spirit light, but it abruptly changed direction and brushed past his fingertips. Twisting mid-air, he caught it with his feet!0\nLi Guanqi pursed his lips. He’d felt Ye Feng would go for that one—it radiated a stronger aura than the others.0\nAs expected, Ye Feng’s face lit up with joy when he inspected the technique within the spirit light.0\nAnd so, the allotted half-hour came to an end.0\nYe Feng braced himself and leaped onto a platform several zhang tall. “Sigh, this was quite a challenge. The spirit lights were flying too quickly. I was barely able to catch this Upper Black-tier technique.”0\nThen, he shot Li Guanqi a taunting glare.0\nLi Guanqi read the technique’s name. Golden Sunset Heart Technique.0\nIt was a technique that matched Ye Feng’s spirit root, making it an excellent choice.0\nLi Guanqi replied with feigned regret, “Sigh. Looks like I won’t be able to keep my spirit stones.”0\nYe Feng laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. “Haha, it’s alright. I’m just a person who loves bets. I love betting on everything. If you lose, I’ll only take half. I, Ye Feng, am an honest gambler. I am a man of my word.”0\nLi Guanqi shrugged and slowly walked up the tall platform, entering the hall. He had long set his sights on a target—a purple light that flew exceptionally quickly.0\nThe moment he stepped into the hall, his aura changed dramatically. Ye Feng watched in shock as Li Guanqi moved faster than himself, charging after a ray of purple spirit light.0\nHowever, the light was moving too fast. Within just a few breaths’ time, it had slipped through the gaps between Li Guanqi’s fingers several times.0\nLi Guanqi’s eyes widened slightly. Then, his gaze flicked to another purple spirit light. 0\nHe reached for the sword box on his back—and let it go.0\nThe heavy sword box dropped straight down.0\nYe Feng frowned and muttered, “Is he trying to shed some weight to increase his speed and agility? But it’s just a sword… Fuck!”0\nBoom!3\nA dull thud echoed when the sword box crashed into the ground, smashing through the stone tiles. Li Guanqi landed on the box, bent his knees, and shot back into the air.0\nCrack!0\nThe powerful force caused the cracks on the stone tiles to spread at a speed visible to the naked eye. Some tiles even shattered instantly.0\nLi Guanqi became a blur as he shot toward the other purple spirit light. When the light sensed his presence, it sped up, trying to escape his grasp.0\nBut Li Guanqi would never let it.0\nThe storage bag tied around his waist flashed and three spirit stones appeared in his hand. With a flick of his wrist, he tossed all three. They collided with the spirit light, forcing it to change direction several times.1\nFinally, Li Guanqi successfully caught the spirit light in his hand.0\nHowever, his brow furrowed as he inspected it. This spirit light… it doesn’t feel powerful at all. 0\nLanding smoothly, he picked up the sword box with one hand and slung it back onto his back.0\nOnly then did he glance up at Ye Feng—who stood there, his jaw slack.0\nLi Guanqi leaped onto the tall platform as gracefully as a gust of wind.0\nLi Guanqi leaped onto the high platform, light as a breeze. He reached out, collected all the floating spirit stones, and smiled. “Thank you for your generosity, Brother Ye. I’m almost embarrassed.”0\nYe Feng finally snapped out of his shock. He pointed at Li Guanqi and shouted, “You… You! You! You!”0\nLi Guanqi blinked innocently. “Me?”0\nYe Feng took a few deep breaths and asked, “How heavy is the sword box on your back?”0\nLi Guanqi shrugged and said, “Five hundred jin.”0\n“Five… five! Five hundred jin?!”0\nLi Guanqi did not respond. If Ye Feng had been at Heavenly Water Peak’s main hall that day, he would have seen him lift a five-hundred-jin barbell with one hand.0\nYe Feng’s eye twitched. “Wait… have you reached the Qi Refinement Realm?”0\nLi Guanqi shrugged with outstretched hands and said, “Yeah, Qi Refinement Level One. If I wasn’t, I wouldn’t be here looking for a technique. My dantian is practically bursting, but I don’t have a cultivation technique to convert the spirit qi I absorbed into vital qi.”0\nYe Feng was shaking from head to toe. He pointed a trembling finger and cried out, “You didn’t tell me!”0\n“You didn’t ask…”0\n“Fine! I won’t argue! But my technique is obviously stronger than yours! I didn’t lose, right?!”0\nDespite Ye Feng’s shock and indignation, Li Guanqi found himself liking the guy—he hadn’t once brought up the spirit stones, only the bet’s outcome.1\nLi Guanqi had no choice but to show him the technique in his hand. Several large characters were written on it:0\nNinefold Spinning Lightning Sutra. Middle Earth-tier. Scripture incomplete. Upper half only. It lacks techniques beyond the Golden Core Realm and is therefore classified as Peak Black Tier.0\nYe Feng’s shoulders slumped in disappointment. He sighed with regret. “Sigh, I lost again! How could I be so unlucky? I can’t believe I still lost in a bet like this!”0\nLi Guanqi smiled. He waved and prepared to leave. “You’re welcome to place another bet with me in the future.”0\nYe Feng shrugged. Looking at the departing Li Guanqi, he said, “The first examination will be in three months. Shall we place a bet?”0\nLi Guanqi turned back and smiled. “What do you want to bet on?”0\nYe Feng thought for a moment, but then scratched his head in frustration. “I can’t think of anything right now. We’ll see when the day comes. I have to win back what I lost today.”0\nLi Guanqi saw the hope shining in Ye Feng’s eyes and blurted, “Why don’t I leave you some spirit stones for your cultivation?”0\nTo his surprise, Ye Feng did not care about spirit stones. Ye Feng merely waved him off. “It’s fine. I’ll just ask my family to send me some later.”0\nThey descended the pavilion together.0\nThe senior on the second floor was still torn about which technique to choose. When he saw Li Guanqi coming down, he pretended not to see him.0\nWhen they exited the Scripture Pavilion, Ling Daoyan suddenly stopped them. Looking at Li Guanqi, he said, “Pay up. Ten spirit stones!”0\nLi Guanqi immediately understood. Suppressing his impatience, he explained, “Old Ling, it wasn’t my fault. Ye Feng was the one who insisted on betting with me. I just… got a little too enthusiastic and damaged the floor a little. It’s fine—Brother Ye Feng said he’d help me pay.”1\nYe Feng’s mouth fell open. He stared at Li Guanqi in disbelief.0\nWhen Ling Daoyan was about to speak, Li Guanqi darted off, leaving Ye Feng standing there in shock.0\nIn the end, Ye Feng still helped Li Guanqi pay.0\n“Li Guanqi! You owe me ten spirit stones! Don’t you know that lending someone money before a bet is bad luck?!” 0"

    "content": "Upon returning to his courtyard, Li Guanqi found his master standing at the entrance. He hurried over with a grin. “Master, what brings you here?”0\nLi Nanting laughed and said, “What else? I came to see what technique you obtained.”0\nLi Guanqi pushed open the door and led him inside the main hall. With a hint of embarrassment, he said, “I got an incomplete scripture…”0\nLi Nanting frowned and asked in a low voice, “You didn’t get the Hybrid Essence Heavenly Lightning Technique?” 0\nStill, he did not press further and merely smiled reassuringly. “It’s alright. When you reach the Golden Core Realm, I’ll take you to some auctions to try your luck. We’ll see if you find something better there.”0\nLi Nanting’s comforting words warmed his disciple’s heart.0\nHowever, Li Guanqi couldn’t tell him why he chose this technique yet.0\nLi Nanting didn’t leave. Instead, he went into the large cultivation room in the side courtyard with Li Guanqi. Once they entered, he waved his hand, and ten low-tier spirit stones arranged themselves into a Spirit Gathering Array.0\nThe spirit qi in the cultivation room thickened instantly.0\nLi Nanting smiled. “I’m here to answer any questions you may have about the technique. This is your first time cultivating—questions are inevitable.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded and didn’t hold anything back. He unrolled the Ninefold Spinning Lightning Sutra and began reading in front of his master.0\nAs expected, the contents were complex and difficult to grasp.0\nThankfully, Li Nanting remained by his side and offered patient explanations, teaching him essential concepts about the meridians of the human body.0\nHe was careful not to overwhelm him—knowing too much too soon would only backfire. What mattered now was that Li Guanqi understood how to guide spirit qi through the technique’s prescribed meridians.0\nAn hour passed. After repeated confirmations, Li Nanting was satisfied that Li Guanqi had memorized the route the spirit qi would travel. He also had him recite a mantra several times, which contained the core concepts.0\nLi Nanting lit a mind-quietening incense stick and placed it before Li Guanqi.0\nAs light smoke rose from the incense, Li Guanqi gained clarity in his Spirit Platform, and his thoughts settled.0\nLi Nanting fell silent. He sat down and watched Li Guanqi quietly, ready to act if anything went awry.0\nThe spirit qi in the cultivation room had reached a decent level. Li Guanqi sat and crossed his legs, entering a meditation posture. He remained composed, not rushing into the process.0\nHe repeated his master’s reminders in his mind, then began his first attempt at cultivation.0\nThe most important thing was to guide the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth through the route recorded in the scripture for one entire day. Any lapse in concentration or stray thought could easily disrupt the process and damage his meridians.0\nIn just a dozen breaths, his breathing steadied into a natural rhythm.0\nLi Nanting beamed with pride as he watched Li Guanqi cultivate with utmost focus.0\nHe had not expected Li Guanqi to have such a strong ability to concentrate. Even after a long time, most disciples struggled to silence their minds.0\nLi Guanqi’s ability to focus his attention so quickly was thanks to his training since childhood. He often zoned out when alone because he had nothing else to do. As such, his mind slipped into quiet states easily, and he could concentrate very well. He could even study a single ordinary rock, utterly absorbed for a long time.0\nWeng!0\nA gentle ripple slowly radiated from his body. 0\nLi Nanting unconsciously straightened his posture, gripping his sleeves. He was ready to intervene at a moment’s notice.0\nLi Guanqi slowly guided the dense Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth into his body. Now came the crucial step of using the spirit qi to break through all the blockages in his body.0\nGradually, the thin mist in his dantian grew denser.0\nFollowing the scripture’s method, he attempted to channel the mist into his meridians. The mist had yet to transform into vital qi.0\nBoom!0\nA soundless explosion echoed in his mind.0\nHis face flushed red. His brow furrowed slightly, as if in pain.0\nLi Nanting’s eyes remained locked onto him, scrutinizing every change. He did not intervene, but inwardly, he anxiously urged him to hold on.0\nBoom!0\nThe dense spirit qi forcefully cleared Li Guanqi’s meridians. The agony he felt was indescribable—it felt like his intestines were being twisted together. 0\nHowever, thanks to all the suffering he had endured, this was still bearable.0\nCompared to the excruciating pain of the medicinal baths he had endured before, this was nothing.0\nSuddenly, a thought struck Li Nanting, and his face fell. Oh no! I forgot to tell him! 1\nHe doesn’t need to clear all his meridians in a single session! He could’ve done it gradually, day by day!0\nBut it was too late. Stopping him now could cause even greater harm, disrupting his dantian and damaging his meridians, which hadn’t yet stabilized.0\nRegret filled Li Nanting’s eyes. If Li Guanqi were injured because of this, he would be wrecked with guilt.0\nLi Guanqi was utterly focused on breaking through. Every time he cleared a meridian, he felt subtle changes in his entire being.0\nAnd just like that, Li Nanting waited for two hours in great anxiety.0\nSuddenly, the spirit qi in the room became a visible current flowing into Li Guanqi’s nostrils. Li Nanting’s eyes widened in disbelief.0\nInitially, Li Nanting expected Li Guanqi to emerge from his cultivation state after a partial breakthrough. However, this phenomenon meant he had already cleared all his meridians. Now, he was beginning the process of channeling the technique through his body for a day.0\nLi Guanqi’s face turned white, and he swayed slightly.0\nA powerful surge of spirit power rushed through his body.0\nWhen Li Guanqi’s face paled, Li Nanting appeared behind him in a flash. Pressing both hands against his back, he channeled an incredibly pure current of vital force into him.0\nAfter that, a voice that echoed like a gigantic bell rang in Li Guanqi’s mind: “Guard the Heavenly Spirit. Quieten the mind.”0\nThe pure vital force filled his body, washing away his exhaustion. With its support, he was able to sustain the circulation of the Ninefold Spinning Lightning Sutra for an entire day.0\nAfter a day, there was a gentle pop from his dantian. It was almost imperceptible, like the bursting of a bubble.0\nHis dantian expanded several times over. The qi coursing through him accelerated, growing faster and faster until the technique became second nature.0\nThen, he absorbed all the remaining spirit qi in the cultivation room until there was nothing left. The qi turned into a milky-white mist that flowed into his dantian.0\nNo one noticed the brief, flickering glow of crimson light from the stone sword box at his feet.0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 28 – Studying The Sword Coffin",
    "content": "Two hours later, once Li Guanqi could skillfully guide spirit qi through his body, Li Nanting quietly stepped out of the cultivation room.0\nThe hardest part was over. There was no need to worry about the rest.0\nLeft alone to cultivate, Li Guanqi slowly opened his eyes and turned to look at the sword box at his feet.0\nHe lifted it upright and examined it closely. Before receiving this sword box, he had never seen anything like the strange creatures carved into it—he had never even heard of them.0\nHe had asked Li Nanting if he recognized the demonic beasts etched into the stone sword box, but he had replied with certainty: those beasts did not exist and were figments of the carver’s imagination.0\nAside from the four great divine beasts, none of the other beasts appeared in the sect’s Myriad Demon Book.0\nLi Guanqi remained silent for a long time, then suddenly kneeled and kowtowed to the sword box.0\nHe waited for a while, but nothing happened. 0\nGetting up, he muttered in confusion, “Was I not supposed to do that? Don’t ancient legends talk about old men who live inside objects like this?”0\nLi Guanqi scratched his head in frustration. He had long suspected that this was no ordinary sword box.1\nOn his first day here, Lu Kangnian had set up a barrier, preventing anyone from seeing what happened when he chose his spirit root. He alone knew why he had picked Lightning—it had been a strange pull in the depths of his heart, an inexplicable sensation.0\nThe same thing had happened at the Scripture Pavilion. He could have chosen any technique, but the sword box had stirred ever so slightly, guiding him toward the incomplete scripture.0\nHe thought for a moment before having another idea. He bit his finger and dripped his blood onto the sword box. 0\nNothing happened.0\n“So it’s not blood-activated? But it should have worked… I heard magical weapons and treasures become bound to their masters through blood…”1\nSuddenly, he perked up with realization. “I didn’t give it enough blood!”0\nHe quickly sliced his wrist open, and blood flowed like a small stream onto the sword box.0\nNot long after, Li Nanting returned to check on Li Guanqi’s cultivation progress. To his horror, Li Guanqi lay unconscious and pale-faced on the ground. Dried blood stained his wrist and the sword box.3\nLi Nanting turned pale, and a flash of panic filled his eyes as he hurried over to the youth’s side to inspect his condition. 0\n“What happened?! What drove you to suicide?!” Li Nanting muttered. “Oh, my foolish disciple… What obstacles did you encounter? Oh my goodness… How much blood did you lose?!”0\nQuickly stopping the bleeding, he retrieved a red jade vial from his storage ring, shook out a pill, and snapped it in half before feeding it to Li Guanqi.0\nUsing a wisp of spirit qi, he helped disperse the pill within Li Guanqi’s body.0\n***0\nOn the second morning, Li Guanqi woke up bleary-eyed. His head felt like lead.0\nAs his vision cleared, he found Li Nanting sitting by his bedside, watching him with gentle concern. Li Nanting massaged his cheeks to make himself look friendlier.0\nWhen he saw Li Guanqi wake up, he quickly passed him a cup of water with a smile and said gently, “Come, drink some water.”0\nSurprised by the kind treatment, Li Guanqi took a careful sip from the cup. “Uh… Master, why are you here?”0\nLi Nanting was silent for a moment. Then, he sat on the stool next to the bed. “Guanqi… I may only be at the Golden Core Realm, but if you ever have a problem, you must tell me! If anyone in the Daxia Sword Sect dares mistreat you—other than the sect master—I will stand up for you! 0\n“What I mean is… don’t resort to extreme measures. Your cultivation path has been smooth so far. Why did you seek death? Tell me… what happened?”0\nLi Guanqi’s heart warmed as he listened to his master’s comforting words.0\nBut he was too embarrassed to tell him the truth…0\nAfter all, the explanation would be, “I thought my sword box was special, so I tried dripping blood on it to make myself its master… but I fainted because I lost too much blood.”0\nAs Li Nanting watched his hesitation, he assumed the worst. His disciple must have offended someone with a powerful background.0\nBoom!0\nHe shot to his feet, his voice thunderous. “Don’t be afraid! Tell me! Who dares to bully my disciple?!”0\nA while later, Li Nanting walked out of the room, rubbing his temples. He shut his eyes for a moment, then let out a long sigh. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.0\nFaced with his master’s outrage, Li Guanqi had no choice but to tell the truth.0\n***0\nAfter that incident, he gained a freeloading little girl in his courtyard.0\nYu Sui’an had broken two ribs when the sword box fell on her. But the moment she found out how Li Guanqi had fainted, she ignored the pain in her ribs and ran down the mountain to laugh at him.0\n“Hahahaha! Turns out you’re dumber than I am! You’re so dumb! You fainted because you lost too much blood! That’s so embarrassing…!”0\nLi Guanqi ignored her and continued practicing his punches on a wooden pole. This was already his third one.0\nSometime later, he revisited the Scripture Pavilion and randomly selected a sword technique: the Azure Lotus Sword Technique.0\nLi Nanting had obtained a pig iron sword for him from the Artifact Hall, the standard assigned to all disciples.0\nWhile the Daxia Sword Sect primarily consisted of sword cultivators, not every disciple was suited to cultivate sword techniques. Many disciples chose to train with other weapons.0\nLi Guanqi also stabilized the first level of his Qi Refinement cultivation during the past two days. The whirlpool in his body was growing rapidly. 0\nLi Nanting checked on him several times, and only after confirming that his disciple had not attempted another blood ritual did he finally stop worrying.0\nLi Guanqi almost never left his courtyard, spending his days practicing swordsmanship. He was not practicing the Azure Lotus Sword Technique, but rather the basic sword forms. Over and over again.0\nAnd just like that, a month passed since he had entered the sect.0\nIn that time, he became the fastest disciple in the history of the Daxia Sword Sect to advance through the cultivation levels. He had progressed from the first level of the Qi Refinement Realm to the fifth level in just one month. His speed was absolutely unheard of.0\nBut Li Guanqi wasn’t the only one making waves.0\nYe Feng of the Heavenly Metal Peak broke through to the fourth level soon after.0\nLin Dong of the Heavenly Earth Peak reached the third level and was about to reach the fourth.0\nEven so, Li Guanqi remained ahead of them.0\nAs a result, the blind youth became known by his peers as the Eldest Senior Brother, an acknowledgement of his undeniable dominance.0\nWhenever he entered the dining hall, people would automatically make way for him. In the sect, they treated him like the moon and stars—always respectful, always polite.0\nBut… 1"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 29 – I Don’t Care!",
    "content": "That night, Li Guanqi sat in the cultivation room and placed the last ten lower-tier spirit stones into the Soul-Gathering Array. He muttered in a low voice, “I can attempt breaking through to the sixth level of the Qi Refinement Realm today.”0\nHis body had undergone a drastic transformation over the past month, and his sensitivity to the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth had also sharpened significantly.0\nHe sat cross-legged and entered a deep cultivation state. The qi within him circulated faster and faster, while the spirit qi in the cultivation room turned into a long ribbon. It flowed into his body and was quickly converted into vital qi. He could feel it—his breakthrough was close.0\nThe sword box at his feet suddenly roared to life, unleashing a terrifying suction force.0\nLi Guanqi, eyes shut tightly, furrowed his brows. His vital qi was starting to flow out of his body uncontrollably. In just a few breaths’ time, his cultivation level had plummeted to the fourth level of Qi Refinement.0\nLi Guanqi suppressed the panic in his heart and did his best to quicken his qi circulation to stop the strange depletion.0\nHowever, no matter what he did, the vital qi in his dantian’s whirlpool continued to flow outward like a river.0\nLevel Three!0\nLevel Two!0\nLi Guanqi’s face turned ashen. He was powerless. He could only watch, helpless, as his cultivation collapsed back to the first level.0\nHis face was pale and his forehead was covered in sweat. His milky-white eyes were filled with despair.0\nScanning the empty cultivation room, he confirmed that no one was around and the door was still tightly shut.0\nSwaying a little, he walked up to the sword box. With a stony face, he said in a low voice, “I can feel you sucking the vital qi from my body. If there’s a spirit in there, I hope we can talk!”0\nSilence.0\nOther than his own breathing, the room was utterly silent. 0\nA long silence.0\nLi Guanqi fixed his eyes on the sword box, which lay on the ground like a lifeless object.0\nHe stepped forward, picked up the sword box, then went outside. 0\nGu Ran, who was just returning from cultivation, spotted Li Guanqi from afar.0\nBefore she could greet him, he rushed to the back of the mountain with the sword box in hand. Seeing his dark expression, she chose not to speak.0\nHowever, she sensed that his vitality was very weak. Thinking that he had just finished cultivating, she did not dwell on the matter.0\nLi Guanqi ran to a cliff behind the mountain. Standing on the edge of the thousand-zhang cliff, he held the sword box out over the edge. He issued one final warning with an icy voice. 0\n“For the last time—are you going to talk or not?”0\nThe sword box remained unresponsive.0\nLi Guanqi huffed coldly. Then, he turned at his waist and dropped the sword box down the cliff.0\n“I gave you face, but you refused to take it!”0\nWithout looking back, he turned and left. He didn’t feel like he had lost anything—everything he had now, he had earned with his own hands. Even if his cultivation had regressed, he could regain it through hard work.0\nDespite having carried this sword box around for some time, he still could not figure it out. It had been a thorn in his side.0\nLi Guanqi’s logic was simple—no matter how powerful the sword box was, it was nothing more than trash to him if he couldn’t use it.0\nDid his heart ache?0\nNo. He didn’t care. 0\nHe had earned everything he had now through his own efforts. The sword box had not given him anything. 0\nBack at his quarters, Li Guanqi halted in his tracks.0\nHovering in midair within his courtyard was the sword box.0\nHe wasn’t the least bit shocked by the strange sight. Instead, he cursed, “Fuck off.”0\nThe sword box trembled. Then, countless rays of spirit light burst from within, converging into the form of a beautiful woman in a red dress.0\nShe was exceptionally tall—at least a head and a half taller than Li Guanqi. Her nose was high and straight, with delicate features, and her skin was as fair and lustrous as jade.0\nHer red dress showed off her curvy figure, tied tightly around her body.1\nHer gaze was as cold as ice and filled with arrogance, like a god looking down at mortals. When paired with her cold aura, she seemed like an immortal from the immortal realm.0\nEven Li Guanqi, who always had a steady mind, was momentarily stunned by her ethereal beauty.0\nBefore she opened her mouth to speak, he put on a stern expression and said, “D-d-don’t… Seduction tricks don’t work on me.”0\nThe woman hadn’t even spoken yet, but her brows knitted together at his words, and a flicker of anger flashed through her eyes.0\nShe flew and sat on the floating sword box. Her hand grazed the sword box, and the hem of her clothing fell slightly, revealing half of her shoulder. Despite that, she acted as if nothing happened. 0\nShe gazed at Li Guanqi with her long, phoenix-like eyes and spoke in a tone as cold as a spring on a winter day, “You do not have the right to own me.”0\nHer scornful words struck him like a dagger to the chest.0\nNo right.0\nWhen he was young, he never had new clothes or shoes.0\n“You do not have the right to wear new clothes.”0\nThat was what his uncle, Li Dashan, used to tell him.0\nLi Guanqi strode over to the girl. 0\nOne step. Two steps. Three steps.0\nWhen he arrived in front of the girl made of light, he stopped and looked up at her. She looked down at him arrogantly. 0\nLi Guanqi grabbed the sword box with one hand and tugged.0\nThud!0\nHe had used so much strength that the floating sword box crashed into the ground.0\nThud!0\nHe stepped onto the sword box’s side and leaned in until his pale eyes were mere inches from hers.0\nHe stared calmly at her, then asked equally coldly, “You’re a mere sword spirit that only managed to show itself after stealing my vital qi. What gives you the right to act so arrogantly? What do you have to back up your arrogance?”0\nThe girl was surprised by Li Guanqi’s boldness, so she was too stunned to react. By the time she returned to her senses, he was so close that she could feel his burning hot breath.0\nShe leaned back slightly, then a powerful force blasted Li Guanqi several zhang back.0\nThere was a flash of anger in her eyes, then she said icily, “I have the right to act this way because I am…”0\nBut the girl did not finish her sentence, swallowing her words.0\nThen, she burst into laughter and adjusted her clothing gently. She said self-chidingly, “I have slumbered for countless years… yet today, I find myself angered by a mere brat.”0\nSlowly, she rose. She cast Li Guanqi a lofty glance, then spoke as if bestowing him a great favor.0\n“From today onward, I want half of the vital force you acquire from cultivating. In exchange, once you reach the Foundation Building Realm, I will allow you to wield one of the swords inside.”3\nLi Guanqi chuckled coldly, then turned and left. “Goodbye. I don’t care for your sword.”0\nPrivately, he thought to himself, What the hell? You’re just a sword spirit trying to steal my vital qi! I can see through your lies.0\nHis attitude infuriated the girl. A flash of killing intent flickered in her eyes, and the sword box started to tremble, slowly opening.0\nSuddenly, a blade appeared and rested itself on her delicate neck, glinting coldly. The girl stiffened, and her eyes filled with rage once again. “You old fart! This is the second time you’ve threatened me!”0\nA magnificent voice boomed in her head. 0\n—You bitch! I will only tolerate three instances of killing intent. After the third strike, I will kill you. My grandson does not respond well to force. If you wish to coexist with him, I suggest you learn a gentler approach.4\nHer expression shifted—disbelief, shock, then reluctant acceptance.0\n“Fine! I’ll return it to him.”0\nThe blade vanished. 0\nShe remained atop the sword box, panting heavily. Then, taking a deep breath, she leaped off the sword box and strode toward Li Guanqi’s room.0"

    "content": "When the girl entered Li Guanqi’s room, the arrogance in her eyes remained, though her expression had softened considerably.0\nLi Guanqi did not know why she suddenly looked much gentler than before. He smiled at her and said, “What’s the matter? Have you fallen in love with me?”0\nShe wanted nothing more than to stomp that perverted grin off his face. But then she remembered the old man’s warning and her current predicament. 0\nShe took a deep breath and said, “We can talk. I can return the vital qi I took from you.”0\nLi Guanqi did not show much emotion and merely gestured for her to sit down. Seeing that she didn’t move, he chuckled and said, “Sit down, and we’ll talk.”0\nOnce she sat, he got straight to the point. “Who are you?”0\nShe replied honestly, “I am a sword spirit.”0\nHe frowned and asked, “A sword spirit who lives in that sword box?”0\nThe girl did not deny it, so he fell into deep thought. “How many swords are there in the sword box?”0\nShe slowly held up three fingers.1\nHe nodded without a word, then asked, “Do you have a name?”0\nThe girl stiffened, then shook her head. “You do not have the right to know my name yet. If you need something to call me, ‘Sword Spirit’ will do.”0\nThough this answer was similar to their previous exchange, Li Guanqi sensed that she wasn’t trying to provoke him. It felt more like… the truth.0\nHe let the matter go. What he really wanted to know was what those three swords were.0\nAs if reading his thoughts, she said, “With your current strength, you cannot withstand the power of any of the swords inside. When you reach the Golden Core Realm, you’ll barely be able to control the first one. As for me… Hehe. Don’t even think about it.”0\nHe shrugged. After some thought, he asked, “What benefits do I get for giving you my vital qi and letting you stay by my side?”0\nShe pointed at herself.0\nHe did not wait for her reply. Instead, he muttered, “Tsk…. She’s quite pretty, but I can only see and not touch. I feel I’m getting the short end of the stick here!”0\nSword Spirit’s face darkened. She had never met someone so shameless. If these were the olden days…0\n“Hmmph! You wish!”0\nSword Spirit leaned her curvy figure on the chair and said, “I meant I could teach you cultivation in the future.”0\n“I already have a master.”0\nHe shrugged. Her offer felt meaningless to him.0\nShe glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. “I. Am. Different. From. Him! He’s a mere Golden Core cultivator. Even if he breaks through to the Nascent Soul Realm, he’ll still be nothing to me! No one else in this world can teach you what I can!”0\nLi Guanqi repeated her last sentence, imitating her tone mockingly. Internally, he mused, This isn’t a mentally disabled sword spirit, is it? Why does it feel like she’s not very bright? What if… I don’t want her?2\nSword Spirit closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Then, she waved and turned into a ray of spirit light, which moved in a specific pattern in the air.0\nLi Guanqi understood the moment he saw the image formed by the light. It was a human silhouette, demonstrating the technique he was currently cultivating from the incomplete scripture.0\nHowever, the path the spirit light followed completely differed from his current cultivation method.0\nShock coursed through him. This new method could triple his cultivation speed.0\nThen, many sutras that were foreign to him appeared next to it. He raised his eyebrows and gasped, “Is this the missing part of the incomplete scripture?”0\nSword Spirit nodded nonchalantly, then pursed her lips and said, “Formulating the second half from the first is child’s play for a trash technique like this! Still, this technique is quite suitable for your spirit root, so you won’t need to change it until you reach the Divine Transformation Realm.”0\nLi Guanqi pouted but did not argue. If you think my current technique is trash, why don’t you give me something better?1\nHowever, he kept his thoughts to himself. Now, the priority was memorizing the missing part’s sutra and route.0\nThe spirit light dissipated after a short moment.0\nSword Spirit looked at Li Guanqi smugly and said, “Do you have any problem with this?”0\nLi Guanqi smiled and waved. “No, of course not. But… I have a question. How much more vital qi do you need?”0\nSword Spirit stood slowly, her posture haughty. “I will keep absorbing.”0\nLi Guanqi’s face fell. “So I’ll have to give you half my vital qi every time I cultivate?”0\nSword Spirit pondered for a moment. “That was only for my awakening. I won’t need more until you reach the Foundation Building Realm. But after that, you’ll have to give me half your vital qi—I need it to maintain my divine spirit.”0\nLi Guanqi sighed in relief. The first examination would be in two months, and he could not afford to give her half his vital qi. If she kept taking it, his cultivation speed would decrease significantly.0\nWhen she walked out of the door, she suddenly turned to look at him. Li Guanqi quickly rearranged his features to a neutral expression—he did not want to anger her again. She was able to rewrite an Earth-tier technique effortlessly! Also, she was the spirit of a sword… just how powerful was that sword?0\nOne day, I will… Li Guanqi coughed. Hold her in my hand!1\nSword Spirit stared at him for three long breaths before saying solemnly, “No matter what, do not die!”0\nThen, she turned into a streak of light and vanished into the sword box, leaving Li Guanqi frozen in place.0\nWhat did she mean? Why did she tell me not to die? With her abilities, she has to be very powerful… so why did she say something so strange? 0\nWait… Could she have been impressed by my magnificence, so much so that she has fallen in love with me?0\nHe shook his head, then smugly ran his fingers through his hair.1\nA mysterious force appeared within him, and his aura strengthened. In the blink of an eye, he returned to the middle of the fifth level of the Qi Refinement Realm—just slightly below his previous peak.0\nSuddenly, an old man blasted his courtyard door open.1"

    "content": "“Guanqi! Guanqi! What happened to you? Gu Ran said that you went to the cliff behind the mountain!”0\n“Where is he?!” Li Nanting yelled, looking around. “Don’t kill yourself! Just tell me if you have anything you’re unhappy about!”1\nCreak~0\nLi Guanqi opened his room door with an awkward grin and said shyly, “Uh… Master, nothing happened. I just went to the back of the mountain to throw away some trash.”0\n“Hey! Who are you calling trash?!”0\nLi Guanqi’s smile froze. He hadn’t expected Sword Spirit’s voice to suddenly ring in his mind!0\nLi Nanting came to his side in a flash and scanned him with his vital force to check his condition. When he found nothing wrong with him besides his aura being slightly weaker than before, he finally sighed in relief.0\nLi Nanting assumed his disciple’s aura had weakened because he had been too impatient with his cultivation, so he couldn’t help but remind him, “Don’t push yourself too hard. Your progress is already on par with the core disciples of powerful major factions. The path of cultivation is long—there’s no need to rush.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded with a grin. “I understand, Master.”0\nRelieved, Li Nanting chuckled. “If you have nothing to do during these two days, you can complete missions from the Mission Pavilion. You’ll get the chance to go down the mountain and explore the region. It’ll expand your horizons.”0\nOnce Li Nanting left, Li Guanqi sighed in relief. If his cultivation level had dropped significantly, he had no idea how his master would’ve reacted—he might’ve lost his mind.0\nSword Spirit’s voice rang in his head. “Since you and I are bound together, I will do my best to help you grow stronger. Use your divine consciousness to scan the sword box—there is a special space inside.”0\nLi Guanqi’s heart skipped a beat. “What kind of space? A storage space?”0\nSword Spirit burst into laughter. “Storage space?! You underestimate me too much!”1\nLi Guanqi didn’t argue. He extended his divine consciousness toward the sword box. As before, he couldn’t see what was inside. It was as if something blocked his perception, but he could sense the space Sword Spirit spoke of.1\nBuzz!0\nA mysterious energy rippled from the sword box, and Li Guanqi disappeared from the room.0\nThud!0\nThe sword box crashed onto the stone tile with a dull thud.0\nLi Guanqi gawked at the shining spirit lights around him. He was surprised to find himself standing on a ten-zhang-wide ancient altar. “What’s this?”0\nSword Spirit gradually materialized on the altar. “Try placing spirit stones on the array.”0\nLi Guanqi looked at a raised stone board on the altar. It had ten indentations.0\nHe took out ten low-tier spirit stones and placed them inside. At once, the stone board lit up with countless mysterious patterns.0\nBuzz!0\nThe pitch-black space around him trembled, and the altar erupted with blinding silver light. However, nothing happened after that, leaving Li Guanqi confused. The spirit stones on the altar were also depleting at a speed visible to the naked eye.0\nHe could not help but ask, “Is this it?”0\nSword Spirit pursed her lips and said, “Here, time moves at double the speed of the outside world.”1\nLi Guanqi frowned and asked cautiously, “Double? Did I hear that right?”0\n“Yes.”0\n“Damn! T-t-this is… Time… time flows differently here?! How is that possible?!”0\nSword Spirit looked at the altar and said softly, “Why wouldn’t it be? Still… ten low-tier spirit stones will only last two hours at most. Mid-tier stones will last a day, and upper-tier ones a month.”0\nLi Guanqi felt a pang of heartache at the cost, but he knew this was an unbelievable opportunity. It was too powerful, and he couldn’t let anyone learn about it.0\nThen, his face fell as he quickly retrieved the spirit stones from the stone board. One-fifth of them had already been consumed. “It’s indeed amazing… but it takes up too many spirit stones.”0\nSword Spirit rolled her eyes at his pained expression. “Work hard on your cultivation and reach the Foundation Building Realm as soon as possible. Once you break through, you’ll be able to wield the first sword in the sword box.”2\nLi Guanqi pursed his lips, his mind racing as he calculated the fortune he’d need for the stone board.0\nWhoosh!0\nHe reappeared in his room, picked up the sword box, and rushed toward his backyard’s cultivation chamber.0\nIn his room, he started to count his spirit stones. He still had a decent number left.0\nHe took out around a hundred spirit stones and lit a sandalwood incense stick as thick as his finger. Then, he entered the mystical space in the sword box.0\n***0\nThe next morning, Li Guanqi stepped out of the cultivation chamber. His gaze fell on the incense stick—half of it remained. The flow of time really was different.0\nA deep emotion surged within him. Two full days had passed in the altar’s space, yet outside, only a single day had gone by.0\nHe clasped his fingers together and muttered, “This thing is terrifying. No one must know about the capabilities of this sword box!”0\nHe washed up in high spirits, preparing to leave for his next class at Heavenly Metal Peak. The elder of Heavenly Metal Peak would be teaching a basic sword technique, so he wanted to listen in.0\nWhen he had just stepped out of his quarters, he met Yu Sui’an, who was holding a bao. When she saw him, she ran over to his side and asked, “Hey! Blind boy, what have you been up to? I haven’t seen you in days.”0\nHe ruffled her hair with a grin. She rolled her eyes.0\n“Little Bao, why do you live so carefreely every day?”0\nYu Sui’an furrowed her brow and answered seriously, “Isn’t that how it should be? Grandfather told me something once.”0\n“What did he say?”0\nShe placed her hands on her back and paced around, just like Li Nanting would. She even comically imitated his facial expression. 0\n“Even when sky-high waves crash above your head, you must still smile and live on!”0\nLi Guanqi froze for a second. The words struck a chord in him.0\nYu Sui’an returned to her usual self and grinned smugly. “What do you think? Didn’t I act just like him?”0\nLi Guanqi was stunned. He felt it made sense. “Yeah, why should a kid be glum all the time? You’ve got a bao to eat every day. That’s happiness. What do you have to worry about?”0\nYu Sui’an pouted. “I do have worries!”0\n“Oh? What worries you?” he asked curiously.0\nShe replied with utmost seriousness, “When I can’t get a bao, I worry about what I’ll eat!”0\n“Hahahaha! Want to stroll around Heavenly Metal Peak with me?”0\n“Okay! Let’s go, let’s go! I want to ride on your shoulders!”0\nThen, the youth and the child ran like the wind toward Heavenly Metal Peak. 0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 32 – Gaining Insight from Sword Techniques",
    "content": "Heavenly Metal Peak’s current peak master was Meng Linhai, as the former peak master, Tu Kui, was still serving his punishment for failing to instill the right values in his disciples.0\nMeng Linhai was also leading today’s lesson. By the time Li Guanqi arrived, the Martial Arena was already packed with disciples.0\nMeng Linhai began, “Today, in addition to the seventeen foundational sword techniques, I will also teach you all another basic sword technique—one with a more offensive focus. When paired with a sprint technique, it can achieve greater effects. Li Guanqi, could you please introduce the seventeen foundational sword techniques?”0\nWith that, he gestured for Li Guanqi to come forward and handed him a pig iron sword.0\nBelow the stage, hundreds of newly joined disciples looked at Li Guanqi with admiration. He shrugged and entered a fighting stance. The sword whistled through the air as he demonstrated the sword technique, and he ran across different sections of the stage.0\nAs he waved the sword, Li Guanqi explained, “The seventeen foundational sword techniques are thrust, pierce, slash, point, uppercut slash, horizontal spin, vertical spin, raise...”0\nCrack!0\nA sharp snapping sound rang out. The force traveled through the blade from hilt to tip, and the pig iron sword shattered into three sections. A standard sword had been unable to withstand Li Guanqi’s demonstration of foundational sword techniques. 0\nMeng Linhai stared in shock. He had not expected Li Guanqi to have such terrifying strength. 0\nLi Guanqi and Meng Linhai looked at each other. In the end, Li Guanqi said, “Uh… Elder Meng, should we switch to a different sword?”0\n“Yes, we should. Pig iron swords are too brittle to withstand your strength. Use mine instead.”0\nLi Guanqi took the magical sword and his entire aura changed subtly. Meng Linhai was the only one present who could perceive the changes in him.0\nClang!0\n“Raise! Sweep, wrap, cut, flick, twist, lift, horizontal slash, vertical slash, and feint!”0\nHe erupted into a flurry of motion. Though these were merely foundational techniques, they seemed anything but simple when demonstrated by him.0\nMeng Linhai’s eyes gleamed with pride. “I didn’t expect you to be this familiar with sword techniques.”0\nLi Guanqi gave a small smile and descended the stage.0\nMeng Linhai said, “The seventeen movements demonstrated by Li Guanqi were all the most basic sword techniques. The more complex sword movements are all built on top of these foundational techniques, either by combining or modifying them.”0\nThen, Meng Linhai took a long look at Li Guanqi. He sincerely felt that Li Guanqi was a natural-born sword cultivator. “I don’t know if you all noticed it, but all the techniques he demonstrated ultimately converged at a single point in the air!”0\nWow!0\nAfter Meng Linhai’s reminder, the disciples were hit with the realization. Even Ye Feng’s eyes lit up with understanding. He muttered, “So that’s why I felt like his movements flowed as smoothly as water. It was utterly graceful!”0\nThe disciples of the other peaks finally understood why his movements seemed so natural.0\nThen, Meng Linhai raised his sword and announced, “Today’s technique is called the Vajra Sword. Watch carefully!”0\nWhoosh!0\nMeng Linhai’s silhouette flickered as vital force surged within him. The sword sliced through the air, leaving a trail of whooshing noises. The sword moved and changed directions as quickly as lightning.0\nLi Guanqi observed his every movement carefully through his heart’s eye. 0\nIn his opinion, Meng Linhai’s movements were simple. They were built upon four fundamental techniques: flick, raise, point, and pierce. It was an offensive routine, and the only way to defend against it was to adapt the same offensive techniques to defense.0\nThe defense against the Vajra Sword was to combine the point, raise, and flick movements to block incoming strikes.0\nOnce Meng Linhai retracted his sword and returned to his standing position, Li Guanqi fell into deep thought. Meng Linhai’s demonstration had opened a metaphorical door in his mind.0\nIt was exactly as Sword Spirit had said—techniques existed in the mind. The same technique could serve different purposes depending on how it was applied.0\nCountless ideas flooded into his mind, and the seventeen sword techniques unfolded into countless possibilities. As the voices around him blurred into the background, Li Guanqi sank into a contemplative state, sitting cross-legged on the spot.0\nMeng Linhai sensed Li Guanqi’s contemplative state and quickly released an intimidating pressure across the hall to silence the crowd.0\nInside his mind, Li Guanqi felt unprecedented clarity. He found himself in a misty white world surrounded by countless copies of himself, each clone demonstrating a different sword technique.0\nOne clone executed a simple point technique, but by just touching his opponent’s weapon, the opponent was sent flying.0\nWait…0\nLi Guanqi felt as if a mental block had been released. The rigid rules of sword techniques no longer bound him; he had transcended beyond them.0\nSometime later, he slowly opened his eyes.0\nHe looked up at the anxious Meng Linhai and said, “I’m sorry for interrupting your class, Elder.”0\nMeng Linhai laughed and said, “Interrupt? If everyone in my class could gain insights like you, I would happily teach every day. So, did you realize something?”0\nLi Guanqi smiled. “Just a little.”0\nMeng Linhai advised him to leave the class and find a quiet place to reflect further. Li Guanqi accepted the suggestion—he needed time to consolidate what he had learned.0\nUpon returning to his cultivation room, he immediately entered a meditative state.0\n***0\nThe next morning, when he woke up, he heard Sword Spirit’s voice. 0\n“Not bad. You’ve barely set foot on the Sword Path, yet you’ve already broken past the rigid constraints of sword techniques. Excellent.”0\nLi Guanqi did not expect Sword Spirit to praise him. He asked curiously, “If you knew about this, why didn’t you tell me earlier?”0\nWith some amusement in her voice, Sword Spirit said, “Some concepts aren’t easy to explain. No matter how many times someone tells you, understanding still depends on personal realization. Even if I had told you to transcend beyond the boundaries of sword techniques, you wouldn’t have grasped what it truly meant.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded in agreement. He wouldn’t have truly understood the concept without the initial insight he gained in class.0\nHe stretched his back and recalled that his master had asked him to check out the Mission Pavilion. After tidying his room, he set off for Heavenly Pillar Peak’s Mission Pavilion.0\nHe had nearly exhausted all the spirit stones he earned, so he needed to find ways to acquire more spirit stones. Otherwise, his cultivation speed would decrease.0\nUpon arriving, he found a crowd of disciples gathered at the entrance, chattering noisily.0\nThrough the gaps in the crowd, he caught sight of something that made his expression darken.0\nThere was a person kneeling on the ground, and he recognized them.0\nBut instead of rushing forward to help, he chose to stand aside and assess the situation first.0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 33 – Dignity Must Be Fought For",
    "content": "Li Guanqi wove through the crowd and spotted several tall, muscular youths surrounding Li Sheng’an. One of them even had a foot planted on him. Li Guanqi’s brows knitted together—he had no idea what had happened.0\nLi Sheng’an had struck him as a smart person, though he could be considered a “terrible good person.” 0\nLin Dong might not have known why Li Sheng’an approached them, but Li Guanqi did.0\nDuring the ascent up the Heavenly Stairs, Li Guanqi and Lin Dong had only spent a small portion of their talismans. If not for that, Li Sheng’an would never have approached them or acted so friendly.0\nNow, Li Sheng’an lay on the ground, blood seeping from his mouth as a burly youth stepped on his chest.0\nThe burly youth twirled a jade token between his fingers and sneered. “Shouldn’t you be sending missions as easy as this one my way as a gesture of respect? Hm? Why are you so forgetful?”0\nLi Sheng’an showed no anger despite the odd looks from the surrounding crowd. Instead, he squeezed his bleeding face into a smile.0\n“I’m so sorry, Senior Brother Wang! I didn’t know you wanted to take a mission during these two days. If I had, I would’ve fought for it on your behalf so you wouldn’t have to come all the way here yourself,” Li Sheng’an said.0\nThe youth called Senior Brother Wang lifted his foot and laughed. Then, he bent over and patted Li Sheng’an’s face loudly, making the flesh on his chubby face tremble. However, Li Sheng’an’s smile did not falter.0\nLi Guanqi stood watching, his expression unreadable. He didn’t make a sound.0\nLi Sheng’an looked up and spotted Li Guanqi. Li Sheng’an’s gaze darkened when he saw Li Guanqi, ashamed to let a close friend see him like this.0\nThe onlookers followed his gaze. Spotting Li Guanqi, a murmur spread through the crowd.0\n“Hey… Isn’t that Heavenly Lightning Peak’s Li Guanqi?”0\nSenior Brother Wang, whose full name was Li Dachun, turned and saw Li Guanqi. His face fell dramatically and he bowed in a panic, loudly greeting Li Guanqi, “Senior Brother Li.”0\nSeeing Li Guanqi remain silent, Wang Dachun wasted no time. He signaled his lackeys and prepared to leave—but not before bowing once more and offering his mission token to Li Guanqi.0\nLi Guanqi burst into laughter. “That belongs to you. Why are you giving it to me?”0\nWang Dachun hesitated, glancing at Li Sheng’an on the ground, who looked like he wanted to say something but held back.0\nWang Dachun did not want to abandon the mission he had received, so he ultimately stowed the mission token away and hurried off. The crowd dispersed, leaving Li Sheng’an on the ground and Li Guanqi beside him.0\nLi Sheng’an smiled bitterly and asked, “Why didn’t you want that mission? That was the third mission Wang Dachun snatched from me.”0\nLi Guanqi stood next to Li Sheng’an and squatted down slowly, fixing his expressionless eyes on Li Sheng’an. “Are you complaining?”0\nFinally, there was some anger on Li Sheng’an’s face. “That’s right! I am complaining! I have nothing left, so can’t I at least complain to a friend?”0\nLi Guanqi disagreed. “No, you can’t.”0\nLi Sheng’an froze. “Why?”0\nLi Guanqi slowly stood up and looked at him out of the corner of his eye. “What right do you have?”0\nLi Sheng’an stiffened. He had no idea why Li Guanqi would ask him that.0\nLi Guanqi continued, “Aren’t you prepared to become a ‘terrible good person’? If that’s the path you’ve chosen, then what right do you have to complain? If this is the kind of person you want to be, you should accept misfortune as fortune. 0\n“Even when someone knocks your teeth off, you’ll swallow it and smile! Isn’t that the path you chose to survive? Since that’s the case, why are you complaining?”0\nHis words struck like thunder. Li Sheng’an was left stunned, unable to speak. Li Guanqi walked to the Mission Pavilion.0\n“If you want to keep being a doormat, then just stay there. Lie down forever. Swallow every insult, every humiliation, and suffer in silence. But if you’ve had enough, stand up. Settle things with your fists.0\n“I can’t help you. No one can. The only one who can help you is yourself.”1\nWith that, Li Guanqi turned and left.0\nLi Sheng’an remained on the ground, his expression shifting through countless emotions. Then, at last, he pushed himself up and left without a word.0\nAt the Mission Pavilion, Li Guanqi accepted a decent assignment: investigating reports of a vengeful ghost haunting a nearby town. The reward was generous at fifty contribution points.0\nContribution points could be exchanged for spirit stones at a ratio of one to two, meaning this mission would earn him one hundred spirit stones. This payout was high because three previous attempts from previous disciples had failed.0\nWhen Li Guanqi walked out of Mission Pavilion, he heard a commotion.0\nThere, at the entrance, stood Li Sheng’an. His face was still bleeding, the bridge of his nose broken, his eyes swollen, and his lips cracked. Yet when he saw Li Guanqi, he grinned and waved a mission token in his hand.0\nLi Guanqi’s lips curled into a smile. He patted Li Sheng’an on the shoulder.1\n***0\nAfterward, Li Guanqi headed to the Treasure Pagoda and exchanged some contribution points for talismans. Then, with a sword on his side, he descended the mountain.0\nHis destination was Cloud Town, a settlement in the southern region of the land under Daxia Sword Sect’s jurisdiction. The townspeople had long made their living by weaving and dyeing cloth, so the town was home to many dye workshops.0\nRecently, however, men had been dying under mysterious circumstances, leaving the town in turmoil.0\nBusinessmen who used to frequent this town no longer dared to visit. Once the Daxia Sword Sect received reports about the situation, they assessed its severity and issued a mission.0\nLi Guanqi was excited, as this was his first time leaving the mountain for a mission. 0\nHe had never seen a ghost before, so he was curious what they looked like. Would it be invisible and formless, like folk legends described?0\nFilled with anticipation, he set off for Cloud Town without delay. The journey was a hundred li, so it took even him one day and one night to arrive.0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 34 – Sleep Paralysis – The Appearance of a Female Ghost",
    "content": "Night had fallen. Deep in the mountains, Li Guanqi pressed forward through the dense forest, where the roars of beasts echoed ceaselessly.0\nThere were many types of demonic beasts in this world. If he encountered a tier-one demonic beast, he would be fine. A tier-one beast wouldn't be much of a threat to him, but a tier-two beast was another matter—its strength was equivalent to that of a Foundation Building cultivator.0\nHe spotted a dilapidated temple on a faraway hill and sighed in relief. At least he had found shelter for the night.0\nHe checked the map on his jade slip and estimated that he wouldn’t reach Cloud Town until the following night.0\nThe staff of the temple had long disappeared. Based on its dilapidated condition, it had clearly been abandoned for a long time.0\nCreak…0\nThe heavy wooden door groaned as he pushed it open. In the stillness of the night, the sound was especially ear-piercing. But Li Guanqi had long grown accustomed to the darkness—he felt no fear of the pitch-black night.0\nThe courtyard was a tangle of withered leaves and thick cobwebs. He swept the webs aside with his sword sheath and stepped through.0\nCrack! Crack!0\nDried leaves cracked beneath his feet as he strode calmly into the temple. This temple was indeed damaged beyond repair—even the Buddha statues inside were missing half their bodies, and their golden paint had been scraped away by scavengers.0\nAlthough Li Guanqi wasn’t religious, he still gave a respectful bow to the statues. Since he would be spending the night, it was only right to inform them of his intentions.0\nHe stepped back outside, gathered some dry branches, and returned to the temple. Then, he started a fire and took out some water and dried meat from his storage pouch.0\nAfter eating enough, he moved a shabby incense table and placed it at the doorway. He lay down on it to sleep.0\nThe fire crackled softly in the otherwise silent temple. Just as Li Guanqi closed his eyes, he felt a cold breeze blow into the temple.0\nHe instinctively tried to open his heart’s eye but saw nothing, no matter what he did. 0\nHis heart skipped a beat. He had barely shut his eyes for ten breaths.0\nCrack!0\nThe crackle of firewood echoed.0\nHe tried to rise, only to find he couldn’t move.0\nA wave of cold sweat soaked his back as the chilly air wrapped around him. His hair stood up.0\nWhat’s going on…?0\nA creeping unease settled over him. He had never encountered anything like this before. His eyelids felt as though they were being pressed shut, completely unmovable. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t open them.1\nYet he was wide awake. He could feel the cold breeze, hear the fire crackling, and even smell the smoke from the fire. But his body refused to obey him.0\nSuddenly, a lady in white appeared beside the incense table, right in front of Li Guanqi. Her long, disheveled hair obscured her face.0\nEvery hair on his body stood on end.0\nThe woman approached him slowly. He could feel her peering up at him from beneath the table. The silent pressure gripped him with terror.0\nThe woman slowly stood up. She began to climb onto the incense table.0\nLi Guanqi was lying on his side and could not move, so he could only watch as the woman climbed the incense table.0\nThe woman reached the top. 0\nThen, she straddled him.0\nShe was weightless, but the weight on his heart was unbearable. 0\nA strange scent coming from her hair reached his nose. His body became much heavier, and he still could not move.0\nWhoosh!0\nHer hair brushed against his neck, and the sensation felt incredibly real—too real.0\nWhat’s going on?!0\nA sudden wetness pressed against his neck. 0\nA… a tongue?!0\nCold. 0\nLong.0\nThe woman’s tongue was almost the length of an adult forearm. It slithered up his neck, reaching the base of his ear.0\nAnd it wasn’t smooth. It was rough, covered in tiny barbs—like a cat’s tongue.0\nIt was such a realistic sensation. 0\nA cold feeling exploded in his head.0\nMove! Move! You’d better fucking move! His mind roared in protest.0\nBoom!0\nWith sheer force of will, he forced his Nine Spinning Lightning Sutra into motion. Lightning vital qi surged from his dantian, flooding his body.0\nBoom!0\nA sharp boom echoed in his mind, as if a seal had been shattered.0\nA layer of purple lightning covered his right hand. He slammed his left hand on the incense table and leaped up. 0\nLightning crackled across his fingers as he seized the woman by the throat and pinned her down.0\nBoom!0\nThe incense table exploded beneath them. Now, the female ghost was pinned beneath him.0\n“Ahhh!” Her wail pierced the stillness of the temple.0\nA yellow talisman appeared in Li Guanqi’s left hand. Vital qi surged within him, igniting the talisman tinged with traces of lightning power.0\n“Materialization Talisman! Materialize!”0\nWhoosh!0\nThe flames shot into the ghost’s form, forcing her ethereal body into physical existence.0\nLi Guanqi frowned. As lightning power surged through his right hand, he cried out, “Where did this ghost come from? How dare you steal my yang qi?!”0\nThe woman’s disheveled hair parted to reveal a beautiful face. It was just too pale.0\nShe cocked her head, shooting him a glare filled with both embarrassment and fury.0\nHe sat on her chest, pinning her down as she materialized into a solid human form due to the talisman.0\nHowever, the position was a little… awkward.0\nLi Guanqi coughed and rose to his feet, but he did not release her neck.0\nWhoosh!0\n“Soul-Binding Talisman!”0\nThe talisman ignited and turned into golden rope that tied itself around the woman. The other end of the rope wrapped itself around Li Guanqi’s wrist.0\nAs long as Li Guanqi still had vital qi within him, she wouldn’t break free from the rope anytime soon.0\nHe studied her, his voice turning stern. “There have been many deaths in Cloud Town recently. Did you have anything to do with them?”0\nThe woman kneeled on the ground, looking up at him with frightened eyes. She spoke in a delicate yet haunting voice.0\n“Esteemed Cultivator… I swear… it wasn’t me. Please, I beg you to investigate this thoroughly. All I do is wait for people to stop in this broken temple and absorb some of their yang qi to maintain my soul so I won’t disappear. I have never killed anyone! Please, Esteemed Cultivator, let me go. I have never set foot beyond this hill in the past twenty years!”0\nLi Guanqi frowned. He activated his heart’s eye, searching for traces of deception. There was no emotional fluctuation in her aura. It didn’t seem like she was lying.0\n“Why should I believe you haven’t left this hill in twenty years?”0\nThe woman hesitated, but when a small current of vital qi containing lightning power flowed through the rope, she hurriedly said, “Because… my bones are buried behind this hill… I cannot go ten li beyond them. If I do, I’ll disappear.”0\nLi Guanqi hesitated for a moment.0\n“Take me there!”0\n 0"

    "content": "The female ghost led Li Guanqi beneath a large tree with an unusually thick trunk, then pointed at its roots. He dug where she indicated and was immediately hit by a pungent stench. 0\nHis expression remained neutral, though his brow furrowed slightly as he gazed at the corpse buried beneath the earth.0\nIt was the body of a young woman in her twenties, and she looked almost identical to the ghost before him.0\nLi Guanqi carefully buried the corpse once more. He had confirmed that the ghost was telling the truth. Then, he said gently, “In that case… do you wish to return to the underworld and enter the cycle of reincarnation? I can help you transcend to the next realm.”0\nLi Nanting had taught him the Transcending Spell. It was a basic spell, something anyone capable of harnessing and controlling the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth could perform. It was not particularly impressive.0\nThe girl looked hesitant. In a low voice, she asked, “Esteemed Cultivator… could I reincarnate two days after today?”0\nHe shrugged. Since she did not explain, he assumed she simply wished to linger in the human realm a little longer and didn’t press the matter.0\nHe got up and returned to the temple ruins. The ghost was still shaken and did not dare approach the temple at all.0\nOn the second morning, Li Guanqi hurried down the mountain with dark circles under his eyes.0\nAs he descended, Sword Spirit suddenly appeared on the mountainside. She took a long, wistful look at the ghost, her eyes filled with arrogance and disdain.0\nThen, her voice rang in Li Guanqi’s mind. There’s… something off about her.0\nHe shrugged, his expression unreadable.0\nSword Spirit took a long look at him, frowning. She hadn’t expected there to come a day when she could no longer discern his thoughts, and he showed no intention of explaining himself.0\nWith a cold huff, she returned to the sword coffin.0\nLi Guanqi gave a small smile. Sword Spirit has a big ego…0\n***0\nWhen Li Guanqi finally arrived in Cloud Town, the first thing he saw was a noisy crowd pushing and shoving each other near the town entrance. He leaped up a tree branch and sat there to observe.0\nMany townsfolk wore brightly colored clothing, likely dyed with various pigments.0\nAt the center of the commotion stood an old man with white eyebrows in Daoist robes, clutching a peach wood sword. He looked terrified, desperately trying to escape the furious mob.0\n“You said you were a Daoist Priest?! You’re just a swindler here to scam us out of our money!”0\n“That’s right! We’ve been feeding you good food and drink, and you haven’t done a damn thing!”0\n“Hmmph! I think he’s a fraud. Let’s just wait for the Esteemed Cultivator from the Daxia Sword Sect.”0\nThe old man clutched his head and lamented, “I’ve been casting spells for three days! The vengeful ghost should have appeared last night. How was I to know she wouldn’t show up?! Wait, don’t hit my face!”0\nLi Guanqi was still perched on the tree when someone suddenly pointed at him. 0\n“Hey! Whose kid is that?! Get down from there! That’s our town’s divine tree! How’d you get up there?”0\nLi Guanqi froze, then noticed the red ropes hanging from the branches, with wooden tokens dangling at their ends.0\nThud!0\nLi Guanqi leaped off the branch and landed on the ground.0\nThe noisy crowd quietened. All eyes fell onto the teenager with pure white eyes.0\nThe people slowly parted, and a white-haired man stepped forward. He scrutinized Li Guanqi before cautiously asking, “Are you the Esteemed Cultivator from the Daxia Sword Sect?”0\nLi Guanqi took out his identity jade slip, which confirmed his status.0\nAll the townsfolk bowed deeply, and the elderly leader announced, “I am Gu Yihong. On behalf of the people of Cloud Town, we welcome the Daxia Sword Sect’s Esteemed Cultivator to our town!”0\nEveryone bowed with sincere expressions.0\nLi Guanqi was shocked. What kind of sect commands so much respect that even a regular disciple is treated with such reverence?0\nThis was the first time he felt proud to be a disciple of the Daxia Sword Sect.0\nStraightening his robes, Li Guanqi returned the bow and said, “I am Li Guanqi, disciple of the Daxia Sword Sect’s Heavenly Lightning Peak. I have been assigned to assist Cloud Town.”0\nGu Yihong was already in his eighties, but his white hair and weary expression made him look even older. Hurriedly, he approached Li Guanqi and pleaded, “Esteemed Cultivator, you must save Cloud Town! Four people have died in just the past few days! The whole town is panicking, and many claim to have seen the ghost with their own eyes.”0\nLi Guanqi gave a slight nod. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a group of men tossing the yellow-robed Daoist priest out of town.0\nAt first, the old priest seemed ready to curse at them. But when he caught sight of Li Guanqi’s eerie white eyes, he swallowed his words, gathered his belongings, and fled.0\nSeeing Li Guanqi’s expression, Gu Yihong explained awkwardly, “News of our troubles have spread to nearby villages. It’s attracted all sorts of conmen trying to take advantage of us. Esteemed Cultivator, please come with me to my home. I’ll explain everything in detail.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded and followed the mayor to his home, with the crowd trailing behind.0\nThe mayor was wealthy. His family’s courtyard spanned a hundred zhang in radius.0\nBy now, word had spread throughout town that a Daxia Sword Sect disciple had arrived. Even those who usually kept to themselves had gathered at the mayor’s residence.0\nThree highly respected elders were already seated in the main hall. After a brief greeting, Li Guanqi began the discussion.0\n“Elder Gu, before I came down the mountain, I was informed of three deaths. Has the number now reached four?”0\nThe elders paled.0\nGu Yihong remained silent for a moment before answering grimly, “That’s correct. Wang Ergou, a resident of this town, died the night before last! And it was a tragic death!”0\nSeeing how pale the mayor had turned, Li Guanqi furrowed his brow and asked softly, “How tragic?”0\nThe mayor exchanged glances with the other elders and fearfully said, “Perhaps… it’s best if you see for yourself.”0\nLi Guanqi rose slowly. “That would be ideal. It’ll help me understand the situation.”0\nWith that, the crowd followed them to a back alley.0\nAlong the way, Li Guanqi observed the townsfolk—men and women, old and young.0\nDyehouses were everywhere, one every ten steps. However, the town was much quieter than normal—traveling merchants had stopped visiting after hearing about the hauntings.0\nSoon, the mayor led Li Guanqi into a small courtyard in a secluded part of town. 0\nLi Guanqi’s expression remained unreadable throughout the journey, carefully observing the faces of those around him.0"

    "content": "On the way, Li Guanqi observed many people, his brows gradually furrowing.0\nSuddenly, an old man’s voice interrupted his thoughts. “Esteemed Cultivator, this is where Wang Ergou lived. He died two days ago, and no one has had time to clean up yet.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded, then he walked straight to the door and gently pushed it open.0\nCreak!0\nThe dilapidated wooden door let out a chilling creak, sending shivers down one’s spine. The sight inside made Li Guanqi take a sharp breath.0\nA strong stench of blood rushed toward him, and the room’s temperature seemed to plummet. The sight before him sent a chill down his back.0\nA burly man hung upside down from a ceiling beam, bound tightly by a thick rope. In one hand, he clutched a pair of scissors—its blade impaling a chunk of flesh.0\nHis eyes had been gouged out, leaving behind two bloody holes. All of his toes had been brutally cut off. But the fatal wound was the long, deep gash across his throat. It was surrounded by numerous smaller slices, as if the blade had been too dull, requiring multiple attempts to sever the flesh.0\nBlood covered the entire floor, now thick and coagulated.0\nThis was Li Guanqi’s first time witnessing such a gruesome scene. He had initially assumed this mission was just about capturing a vengeful ghost wreaking havoc.0\nNow, it seemed far more complicated than he had imagined.0\nHe got up and scanned the chaotic and cluttered room, but found nothing particularly unusual apart from the mess.0\nHe pulled out a Purification Talisman and channeled his vital qi into it. The talisman instantly ignited. When the Purification Talisman touched the blood on the floor, it exploded.0\nAs the flames burned, a thick black smoke billowed into the air from the center of the blood. Moments later, the smoke dissipated, and the chilling presence in the room faded.0\nThe onlookers nodded in approval.0\nAt first, they had thought the Daxia Sword Sect had sent a mere novice to handle this matter, Li Guanqi was doing much better than the previous investigators. They had only examined the scene and hadn’t been able to find anything of value.0\nLi Guanqi stood on the spot and frowned at the density of the black smoke. This is going to be a tough one.0\nHe turned and spoke, his tone measured. “Have someone clean up the body and arrange for burial as soon as possible. The weather is hot. If we wait too long, the corpse will start rotting.”0\nThe old man quickly called for help to take care of the body.0\nAfterward, he approached Li Guanqi uneasily and whispered, “Esteemed Cultivator, do you have confidence in dealing with this evil ghost?”0\nLi Guanqi smiled faintly. “Whether I am or not, I have to try. I plan to stay here for a few days. Yang qi is strong during the day, so the ghost won’t act until nighttime. Tonight, I will lure it out.”0\nHis words were meant to reassure the villagers, though he wasn’t entirely confident.0\nHe turned to the sword box and asked, “Sword Spirit, do you have any ideas?”0\nAfter a brief silence, a voice echoed in his mind. 0\n“Tsk, I thought you were more capable. Turns out you were just putting on a brave face.”0\nSword Spirit continued, “It’s simple. At exactly thirty minutes past the hour of the ox,[1] sit by the south-facing window and cultivate. That will lure her out.”0\nLi Guanqi frowned slightly. “Why the hour of the ox?”0\nSword Spirit’s voice was filled with impatience. 0\n“The hour of the ox is the time when the concentration of yin qi in the air is at its peak. The window is the most straightforward access point for her to strike. As for cultivating… you’re already like a lantern in the night. Doing so will just make you shine brighter.”0\nAfter a pause, Sword Spirit added, “But don’t worry. This time, I can intervene.”0\nLi Guanqi was momentarily stunned. He hadn’t expected Sword Spirit to offer assistance.0\nHe chuckled. “What? Worried about me? So much so that you’ll make a move yourself?”0\nThere was silence.0\nAfter a long pause, Swore Spirit's voice echoed once more, her tone a blend of disdain and arrogance. 1\n“You must be blind if you can’t recognize your own limits. Worried about you? I just don’t want to lose my source of vital power. I can absorb some of the resentful energy from this ghost. Before you reach the Foundation Building Realm, I still need to absorb power from other sources.”0\nWith that, she fell silent again.0\nLi Guanqi smiled slightly and murmured, “Looks like we got this.”0\nAs nightfall was still some time away, Li Guanqi joined the villagers for a local meal. The spicy flavors whet his appetite.0\nCloud Town lay in a valley, surrounded by mist-laden mountains. The air was humid, so the locals favored spicy food to induce sweating and dispel internal coldness from their bodies.0\nBy the afternoon, Li Guanqi was leisurely strolling through the village.0\nThe villagers had been too afraid to get caught out of their homes at night, so they always went home early. Now, with his presence, they dared stay outside while the sun was still up.0\nDuring this time, he gathered bits and pieces of information from the townsfolk. Squatting by the roadside, he frowned, feeling like the entire situation was a tangled mess.0\nThe first victim was a man named Zhang Daniu. He once had a mute wife who mysteriously disappeared years ago. 0\nAfterward, he took in a widow from the village, and they lived together. When Zhang Daniu died, the widow also vanished. 0\nThe subsequent victims were all men—some single, some married.0\nLi Guanqi furrowed his brows. What exactly is the connection between these people?0\nNot far away, two middle-aged women were cracking melon seeds, glancing around as they whispered animatedly.0\nEven from a dozen meters away, Li Guanqi could tell they were discussing something significant.0\nHe reached into his storage bag, pulled out some mountain pastries, and strolled over casually. He handed them the pastries with a smile. “Elder Sisters, what are you talking about? I have a couple of extra snacks. I can’t finish them. Why don’t you have some?”0\nThe plump woman beamed as she accepted the gift. “Oh my, young Esteemed Cultivator, you’re too kind!”0\nLi Guanqi chuckled, seizing the chance. “I saw you two chatting really excitedly. Care to share the story with me?”0\nThe thinner woman glanced around cautiously before leaning in and whispering, “What else could we be talking about? It’s about those who died, of course!”0\nLi Guanqi’s expression sharpened, and he instinctively lowered his voice. “Do you have some inside information?”0\nThe plump woman glanced around, making sure no one else was listening. Then, she leaned in even closer and whispered, “Retribution!”1\n1. Between 1:00 and 3:00 AM. ☜0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 37 - Vengeful Ghost’s Soul Lock, Unraveling the Mystery",
    "content": "Li Guanqi had just uncovered a dark secret that most of the town deliberately avoided discussing.0\nAs the sun gradually set, the golden glow of the sunset disappeared behind the mountains. The two women who had spoken to Li Guanqi hurried home.0\n“Li Lanhua, Zhang Cuifen. Child traffickers,” Li Guanqi murmured calmly, his face unreadable. The tangled mess in his mind had finally begun to unravel.0\nNow, all that remained was to wait for the vengeful ghost to appear and uncover the whole truth.0\nNight fell. The mayor had long since left his house, leaving Li Guanqi alone in the courtyard.0\nThe brightly lit room was empty, save for a single oil lamp and a torn paper effigy positioned in front of the flame. The lamp cast a shadow of a person sitting upright on the window.0\nThe moment the hour of the ox[1] arrived, the already silent Cloud Town grew even stiller. Not even the wild dogs made a sound, as if the town had been swallowed by death itself.0\nAn unusually chilly wind swept fallen leaves along the ground.0\nSuddenly, a ghostly figure flickered into existence, appearing atop a tree branch at the village's entrance. The next instant, it shot toward a house on the town’s western side.0\nInside the tightly shut house, a rugged-looking man lay snoring heavily on his bed.0\nThe vengeful ghost materialized directly above his face, barely three inches away.0\nA crimson, elongated tongue slithered through the air—then plunged straight into the man’s forehead.0\nHis snoring stopped instantly. His body stiffened, and his eyes snapped open, filled with horror.0\nMeanwhile, at the Daxia Sword Sect’s Heavenly Pillar Peak, a sect elder flew swiftly on his sword, rushing toward the Mission Pavilion. “Hurry! Raise the Cloud Town mission to the third tier immediately! No one below the Foundation Building realm is allowed to take it!”0\nThe female disciple behind the counter quickly adjusted the mission’s difficulty. But as she did, she noticed a disciple had already accepted the mission two days ago. She immediately reported this matter to the steward.0\nThe steward’s face darkened. “Who took it?!”0\nThe disciple checked the records, and her face paled. “I.. found it..”0\nThe steward scowled, growing impatient at her hesitation. “Speak! Who accepted the mission?!”0\n“Heavenly Lightning Peak disciple. Li Guanqi...”0\nAt those words, the steward’s face turned ashen. The disciple who took the mission was none other than the newly accepted prodigy of the Daxia Sword Sect.0\nThe thought of an enraged Li Nanting flashed through his mind. He grabbed his jade slip without hesitation and sent a frantic message to the Heavenly Lightning Peak.0\nAn immense surge of energy erupted from the peak, shaking the entire sect.0\nA brilliant streak of light shot into the sky from the Heavenly Lightning Peak, tearing through the night as someone rode their sword at full speed toward Cloud Town.0\nThe steward swallowed hard. He could only pray the young disciple was still alive. Otherwise, he’d face more than just losing his job—his punishment would be severe.0\nBack in Cloud Town.0\nA strand of ethereal green silk extended from the burly man’s forehead, held between the ghost’s fingers like a puppet string. His lifeless eyes stared ahead as he walked to the kitchen.0\nHe moved to the cutting board step by step. His left hand pressed down on the wood, and his right hand reached for a knife.0\nHe was fully aware of what was happening, but his body was no longer in his control.0\nA chilling laugh echoed in his ears. “Hehehe… Are you scared?”0\nThe eerie voice slithered through his mind like the whisper of the grim reaper, sending shivers down his spine.0\nHis wide, terrified eyes gleamed like copper bells. His lips paled and cold sweat drenched his forehead. Yet, despite the terror consuming him, his body moved of its own accord.0\nThe knife slowly rose into the air, preparing to fall. 0\nSuddenly, a voice drifted out from the room’s shadows. “Should I call you Li Lanhua… or Zhang Cuifen?”0\n“Who?!”0\nThe ghost, enshrouded in black mist, whipped her head around to glare at the dark corner.0\n“I am not that whore Zhang Cuifen! Whore!”0\nThe black mist surrounding her churned wildly, her emotions thrown into turmoil by that name.0\nLi Guanqi stepped forward from the darkness, peeling a Qi Restraining Talisman off his body.0\nThe ghost froze the moment she saw him.0\nSimultaneously, Li Guanqi’s heart’s eye activated, allowing him to see her true appearance—the woman from the ruined temple he had encountered yesterday. 0\nHowever, her aura now was completely different.0\nHer gaze turned icy cold. She swiped her hand and sent a black palm strike hurtling toward him.0\nLi Guanqi’s heart skipped a beat—he had barely dodged in time. The attack smashed into the wall, leaving a deep, scorched imprint that would have seriously injured him if it had landed.0\nClang!0\nHis sword flashed from its sheath. He quickly channeled his vital qi, coating the blade in a thin layer of lightning-based vital qi. Tiny arcs of electricity crackled visibly along the edge.0\nDespite the intense pressure radiating from the ghost, Li Guanqi charged forward without hesitation. He raised his sword to use the Azure Lotus Sword Technique. It was only at the middle stage, but it was his strongest attack.0\nThree radiant green lotus sword waves bloomed in succession, slashing toward the ghost.0\nThump!0\nShe ignored the sword waves completely, charging forward head-on.0\nAfter all, a ghost’s soul form made ordinary vital qi attacks completely harmless.0\nLi Guanqi had already cut off his retreat by slashing out the Azure Lotus technique. He could only infuse his vital qi ferociously into his sword.0\nStrange cracking sounds emanated from the fine sword in his hands, which instantly cracked all over. 0\nThe vengeful ghost lunged toward Li Guanqi. Her sharp claws nearly reached his eyes.0\nAt the last moment, the three lotus sword waves struck.0\nBoom!0\nThe attack was so powerful that it shattered the wall behind them, sending the ghost flying backward a dozen zhang.0\nThe silk thread connected to the man’s forehead snapped instantly. 0\nLi Guanqi’s sword could not withstand the strain and broke apart, leaving only the hilt in his hand.0\nThe burly man regained consciousness. And when he realized what had just happened, his face contorted in terror. “Li Lanhua?! But… you’re already dead! A g-ghost… is it my turn to die now? No, I don’t want to die!”0\nPanic overtook him. He bolted from the house, overwhelmed by fear.0\nLi Guanqi frowned. Without hesitation, he ignited a Soul-Binding Talisman. Golden chains shot out, restraining the ghost. 0\nThen, he threw the broken sword hilt towards the man. It hit the man's head squarely.0\nThud!0\nBound in golden chains, Li Lanhua slowly lifted her blood-red eyes and glared at him. 0\nHer voice was cold. “Are you trying to protect him?”0\n1. The hour of the ox starts at 1:00 AM and ends at 3:00 AM. ☜0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 38 - The Path to Immortality Opens, Enter Reincarnation",
    "content": "Li Guanqi shook his head slightly and murmured, “Not necessarily.” 0\nMaintaining the Soul-Binding Shackle, he continued, “Actually, I have a few questions.”0\nThe delicate female ghost who had appeared at the ruined temple on the mountain was none other than Li Lanhua. The remains back there couldn’t have been hers, but they also bore traces of her aura. Something didn’t add up.0\nHe crouched before the female ghost and said, “The corpse on the mountain isn’t yours. It should belong to that widow, Zhang Cuifen.”0\nThe ghost beneath him immediately raised her head and glared fiercely at Li Guanqi. “Do not mention that vile woman in front of me again! That’s right! I killed them all! Li Daniu was the last one who deserved to die! Young man, if you try to stop me, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”0\nLi Guanqi let out a soft sigh. That afternoon, he had uncovered some hidden truths from two women. This case was one of Cloud Town’s biggest scandals, buried and forgotten over time. Only the recent string of murders had dredged it back up into the people’s minds.1\nAt the heart of this tragedy was the female ghost before him.0\nLi Lanhua had lost her parents at a young age. Human traffickers abducted her, cut her tongue, and sold her to a brothel.0\nBy turning thirty, she was deemed worthless and resold to Zhang Daniu of Cloud Town. She had long grown weary of worldly suffering and thought her hardship was finally over, allowing her to live out her remaining days in peace as a wife and mother.0\nBut Zhang Daniu, lustful and unfaithful, soon took up with the town widow, Zhang Cuifen.0\nLi Lanhua, a hardworking and dutiful woman, disappeared mysteriously. Around the same time, rumors began spreading throughout the town—whispers that Li Lanhua had been shameless, spending too long in the brothel and seducing men all over town. 0\nLi Guanqi recounted everything he knew, unaware that the ghost beneath him was trembling violently.0\nBoom!0\nA terrifying shockwave sent Li Guanqi flying. A chilling wind engulfed all of Cloud Town.0\nLi Guanqi’s expression changed drastically as he glanced down at the Soul-Binding Shackle in his hand. The yellow talisman inside had begun to crack.0\nBang!0\n“I never seduced anyone! It was him! It was him!”0\nLi Lanhua’s face twisted with madness, her resentment surging like a tidal wave.0\nLi Guanqi, carrying his sword box, hopped onto the roof. From a distance, he watched Li Lanhua unleash her fury.0\nEven then, he goaded her, saying, “Oh, did I say something wrong?”0\nBoom!0\nThe vengeful ghost’s twisted face suddenly transformed into a seductive middle-aged woman. Li Lanhua pointed at her own face and roared, “It was that vile woman! What does any of this have to do with me?! I was the one who was wronged! 0\n“Why?! Did I have to bear all the insults and slander just because I was mute? They were the ones who truly deserved to die! Zhang Daniu was a beast who let them take turns humiliating me!”0\nLi Guanqi watched the hysterical woman and sighed inwardly. “So, did the skeleton under the temple tree belong to Zhang Cuifen?”0\nLi Lanhua’s gaze turned icy. Her form blurred into a dark shadow that shot toward Li Guanqi.0\nHis vision blurred, and Li Lanhua’s ghastly pale face appeared right before him.0\nLi Guanqi raised his arms to block, but an immense force slammed him into the ground.0\nThump! The impact shattered several bricks beneath him.0\nLi Lanhua gripped his arms tightly and screamed hysterically, “That’s right! I tore that vile woman’s soul apart! I chewed her up, piece by piece! 0\n“It strengthened me, but that’s not what I was after. I just want revenge! I want them all to die horribly! And if you stand in my way, I’ll kill you too!”0\nDespite being pinned to the ground, Li Guanqi sighed inwardly. She was a pitiful soul who had suffered a lifetime of suffering. She never knew a moment of happiness, yet she was branded as a woman of vice.0\nFrom the start, he had not sensed a single trace of true murderous intent from her. 0\nAt this moment, the sword case on his back moved. In the end, he still had to let Sword Spirit take action.0\nA flash of light split through the air. The vengeful ghost burst apart, her black resentment swirling into smoke, which was swiftly drawn into the sword case. 0\nIn an instant, Li Lanhua’s soul became faint and transparent, barely holding together.0\nRealizing her power was gone, she collapsed to the ground, as though she had lost her soul.0\nThen, mysterious incantations of a Soul-Guiding Curse surfaced in Li Guanqi’s mind. This chant was far more profound than what he had learned at the Daxia Sword Sect.0\nLi Lanhua looked at the unconscious man on the ground, then turned back to Li Guanqi with pleading eyes. The frail figure kneeled and bowed repeatedly.0\nAs her form grew fainter and fainter, she bowed one last time. “I have no attachment to my wretched life... but the purity I reclaimed after redeeming myself—I cherish it more than life itself. Ever since becoming a vengeful spirit, I have never harmed the innocent. 0\n“I know your sect forbids you from interfering, yet I still dare ask... Please, Esteemed Cultivator, help me correct this injustice! Clear my name! Speak on behalf of this mute woman! Let the world know I was the true victim, wronged by lies and deceit!”0\nLi Guanqi closed his eyes, feeling a heavy weight in his heart. He knew the truth, but no one else did.0\nOr perhaps… they had all known, yet chose silence. It was the same, yet somehow different. 0\nHe recited the Soul-Guiding Curse with sincerity. 0\nA sacred white light enveloped Li Lanhua. She closed her eyes as tears slipped down her face, filled with bitterness.0\nLi Guanqi slowly rose and walked toward the unconscious man. 0\nThump! 0\nHe kicked him, shattering his nose. The man woke with a groan, only to have his hair yanked upward.0\nLi Guanqi whispered coldly into his ear, “Do you see her? The woman you and the others violated to death.”0\nThe man only saw the fading spirit, but his eyes lit up with joy.0\nCrack!0\nLi Guanqi twisted and snapped the man’s neck.0\nIn the glow of the holy light, tears streamed down Li Lanhua’s face like a broken dam. She bowed deeply and whispered, “May your path to immortality be smooth.”0\nLi Guanqi stood still, watching the light fade. He murmured, “Do you feel wronged…? Those who slandered you knew better than anyone how wronged you were.”0\nSword Spirit cut in and slowly said, “Was it worth it?”0\nLi Guanqi laughed freely and said lightly, “Yes! If not for this, why cultivate immortality at all?”0\nSword Spirit fell silent. 0\nThe next instant, boundless vital qi surged through Li Guanqi, assisting his breakthrough to the sixth level of the Qi Refinement Realm.1"

    "content": "The town remained silent for a long time. Not a single sound broke the stillness.0\nMany people were still awake. The bolder ones peeked out from their windows to see what had happened outside.0\nThey saw a young man sitting calmly, cracking melon seeds. Beside him lay a corpse.0\nBuildings had collapsed, and the streets were riddled with deep craters and sword marks.0\nBoom!0\nEarlier, Li Guanqi had gone to Zhang Daniu’s house and retrieved a skeleton from the well. It was none other than the remains of Li Lanhua.0\nAfter giving her a proper burial, he slowly stood up. Just then, a dark shadow appeared in the distant sky.0\nMoments later, Li Nanting descended from his flying sword. The sword circled once before returning to its sheath.0\nLi Nanting moved swiftly to Li Guanqi’s side. After examining him, he found that not only was Li Guanqi unharmed, but he had also broken through to the sixth level of the Qi Refinement Realm.0\nLi Guanqi gave a vague and evasive explanation, saying that his Lightning Spirit Root had been particularly effective against the vengeful ghost, allowing him to clinch a narrow victory.0\nLi Nanting was skeptical but didn’t press further. He simply took Li Guanqi on his flying sword and returned to the Daxia Sword Sect.0\nBefore leaving, Li Guanqi cast a deep gaze at Cloud Town. He was still thinking of Li Lanhua, who had died unjustly.0\nHe murmured, “It is said that suffering is followed by happiness, but she suffered year after year with no end.”0\nOn the way back, Li Guanqi recounted the events in Cloud Town.0\nLi Nanting remained silent for a long time before softly saying, “Guanqi, this is the human heart. This is human nature.”0\nLi Guanqi fell quiet for a while before replying, “I understand, but every time I witness something like this, I can’t help but feel the coldness of human nature. If someone had stood up for Li Lanhua back then, if someone had spoken for justice, would things have turned out differently?”0\nLi Guanqi sighed and continued, “But… there are no ‘‘what ifs’ in this world.”0\nLi Nanting remained silent. Personal experience was the only way to grasp certain truths and things.0\n“Uh… Master, can you give me some spirit stones? Earning contribution points is way too hard! It was a simple first-tier mission, but I faced a terrifying, vengeful ghost.”0\nLi Nanting’s expression darkened. Just thinking about how his disciple had nearly lost his life made his anger flare.0\nIn the end, he simply told him not to worry about it.0\nLi Guanqi didn’t rest after returning to the sect. As usual, he meditated and cultivated.0\nSword Spirit kept her promise and refrained from stealing his vital qi.0\nThe next morning, Li Guanqi woke from his cultivation. He felt refreshed, his mind clear and sharp.0\nHe set up the wooden stake he had prepared in advance, then practiced his boxing forms dozens of times. After a thorough warm-up, he took out a refined iron sword and started an intense sword training session.0\nThe sky was still dark, yet Li Guanqi had already been at it for two hours. 0\nJust then, Sword Spirit’s voice suddenly echoed in his mind.0\n“Move with the sword. Do not let the sword move you!0\n“Your slashes must be swift. Faster!0\n“Before thrusting, gather your strength. Unleash it with your entire body!”0\nHer words gave Li Guanqi an epiphany. He slightly adjusted his technique, and his expression grew more focused.0\nClang!0\nThe sword shot forward, slicing through the air with a sharp sonic boom. The thick wooden stake exploded into splinters.0\nBang!0\nA smile crept onto Li Guanqi’s lips. He hadn’t expected Sword Spirit to have such keen insight, even pointing out details his master had overlooked. She could pinpoint precisely what he needed to improve.0\nAfter his training, Li Guanqi was surprised when the sect’s steward came looking for him.0\n“Hahaha! Truly a hero in his youth!0\n“This time… the Mission Pavilion acknowledges their mistake, so your contribution points will be multiplied fivefold! The points have already been added to your jade slip.”0\nLi Guanqi chuckled. “Then I must thank Steward Zhou. I’ll bring you two bottles of fine wine later.”0\nSteward Zhou grinned in relief. He had been worried since yesterday.0\nFortunately, Li Guanqi had persuaded his master, saying, “If you get mad at him, won’t that make life harder for me? How will I take on missions then?”0\nAs such, Li Nanting warned Steward Zhou rather than punishing him, which led to the current situation.0\nLi Guanqi understood the concept of taking actions for mutual benefit. He needed the help of others to reach greater heights.0\nThe sight of Steward Zhou smiling at Li Guanqi filled many outer sect disciples with envy.0\nWith a hefty amount of contribution points and a storage bag containing one thousand low-grade spirit stones from Li Nanting, Li Guanqi no longer had to run around taking missions for cultivation resources.0\nOver the next month, he consistently went to the sect’s Spirit Ascension Platform. During this time, his strength skyrocketed. 0\nIn just one month, he had reached the seventh level of the Qi Refinement Realm.0\nThis rapid advancement shocked everyone, making them realize the massive gap between themselves and a true prodigy.0\nLi Guanqi trained tirelessly, like a machine. Apart from sword practice, he devoted himself entirely to cultivation.0\nHe often visited the sect’s training grounds in the remaining time. He could enter a specialized room imbued with formations for just one low-grade spirit stone.0\nInside, he had access to any weapon he desired and a vast space with a radius of a hundred zhang.0\nAfter a month of training, his Azure Lotus Sword Technique had reached late-stage perfection.0\nWhen he struck, his sword hummed like a chorus, instantly forming six blooming lotus flowers. However, when he showed off to Sword Spirit, she merely scoffed.0\n“Useless flashy trash.”0\nLi Guanqi sneered. “Talk is easy. If you’re so great, teach me a better sword technique!”0\nShe was tired of his superficial swordplay and decided to intervene. When she materialized, her elegant figure momentarily stunned Li Guanqi.0\nWith a graceful movement, she summoned a spirit sword of vital force into her palm.0\nShe lowered her stance, her gaze turning razor-sharp. Then, all Li Guanqi could see was a flash of sword light.0\nSword Spirit smirked arrogantly. “Did you catch that clearly?”0\nStill full of questions, Li Guanqi left the training grounds and rushed toward the Sword Tower.0\nThe Daxia Sword Sect’s Sword Tower was renowned across hundreds of thousands of li.0\nThe Sword Tower was entirely black and looked extremely solemn.0\nIt had thirty-six floors, divided into three tiers. Cultivators from the Qi Refinement Realm to the peak of the Golden Core Realm could enter. They faced increasingly powerful sword-wielding puppets at each level. The higher one climbed, the more opponents they faced at once.0\nNo Golden Core cultivator had ever withstood a challenge from twelve Golden Core sword puppets.0\nOnly the founding sect master had ever reached the thirty-third floor. The sect master was also the sole individual to ascend to the Immortal Realm in the sect's history.0\nThis was Li Guanqi’s third visit to the Sword Tower. 0\nDespite his monstrous talent, he had only reached the sixth floor so far.0"

    "content": "Many disciples noticed Li Guanqi and looked at him with admiration and envy.0\n“Sigh… If only I didn’t have to worry about cultivation resources every day.”0\n“Pfft, even if you had all those resources, you wouldn’t cultivate as fast as him!”0\nA female cultivator from Heavenly Water Peak gazed at Li Guanqi, infatuation shining in her eyes. “Wow! Senior Brother Li is challenging the Sword Tower again! Do you think he’ll reach the seventh level this time?”0\nThe girl beside her, cheeks flushed, replied, “He should… He definitely can!”0\nLi Guanqi, however, paid no attention to the chatter around him. His entire attention was on the sword strike that Sword Spirit had shown him. Even if he had noticed their conversation, he wouldn’t have cared. His only concern was‌ whether he could reach the seventh level today.0\nIn his mind, he kept replaying the image of Sword Spirit displaying the sword strike.0\nWhat he didn’t realize was that the move had been nothing more than a casual slash for her. She hadn’t expected him to comprehend much from it. Even an offhanded strike of hers was unfathomably powerful.0\nLi Guanqi placed a spirit stone onto the formation, and his brows relaxed.0\nBuzz!0\nThe transport array of the Sword Tower instantly teleported him to the seventh level. When he arrived, his eyes fell on the seven pitch-black puppets that had caused him so much trouble.0\nIf he took even half a step forward, these seven puppets—each matching his cultivation level—would immediately attack.0\nLi Guanqi huffed and slowly reached for the longsword at his waist. His hand moved with deliberate control as he mirrored Sword Spirit's exact stance from earlier.0\nSword Spirit watched this scene in disbelief.0\nDoes he really have such incredible comprehension ability?1\nBuzz!0\nThe longsword trembled slightly, and Li Guanqi’s entire aura instantly changed.0\nThen, he stepped forward. The seven metal puppets’ eyes lit up with a faint blue light.0\nThey moved together simultaneously, attacking Li Guanqi from seven different directions. The sound of swords slicing through the air echoed in his ears.0\nHowever, Li Guanqi remained motionless.0\nJust as the seven longswords were mere inches away from reaching him, Li Guanqi’s eyes snapped open. His once lifeless gaze erupted with sharp intensity.3\nClang!0\nHe drew his sword. A flash of sword light—quick as lightning.0\nBefore the lingering hum of the unsheathing faded, his longsword was already back in its scabbard.0\nBoom! Bang! Bang! Bang!0\nA series of muffled explosions rang out. The seven puppets remained frozen, each bearing a deep gash across its chest.0\nLi Guanqi turned and stepped off the transport array, murmuring softly, “Such a fast draw technique…”0\n“I’ll call it Thunderbolt.”0\nSword Spirit watched in silence from inside the sword case. I never expected his talent in swordsmanship to be this extraordinary! Could this be fate…?0\nShe suddenly chuckled before she could finish her thought. Heh, since when did I start believing in fate? Su Xuan… did you really just give me to him on a whim?0\nAs she watched Li Guanqi’s departing figure, she couldn’t help but ponder a lingering question that had troubled her for a long time. 0\nShould I help him? The stronger he becomes, the better it is for me.0\nOne month before the entrance examination, Li Guanqi became the busiest person in the sect. Every day, his master came to check on his progress.0\nAfter his master left, it was time for Sword Spirit’s harsh training. Because of this, his cultivation advanced at an astonishing pace.0\nAmong the new disciples, he was undoubtedly leading in training progress. However, disciples from other peaks were also breaking through rapidly, such as Ye Feng from the Heavenly Metal Peak and Lin Dong from the Heavenly Earth Peak.0\nLi Guanqi wasn’t the only one who was training hard. Many others were cultivating tirelessly, unwilling to slack off even a little.0\nSword Spirit also modified the sword technique Li Guanqi had been practicing. That’s right, she had changed it, discarding the once elegant Azure Lotus Sword technique and leaving only its swiftest movements.0\nWhen questioned about it, her answer was simple: “Speed is the only thing that matters! Everything else is useless. If your sword is fast enough, you can stab your enemy’s throat before they can even react.”0\nThe draw technique Li Guanqi had secretly learned was the ultimate embodiment of speed, precision, and lethality.0\nSeven days before the entrance examination, Li Guanqi had already reached the ninth level of the Qi Refinement Realm. His cultivation speed didn’t just shock everyone—it even caught the attention of Sect Master Lu Kangnian.0\nDuring a speech to motivate all disciples, he openly praised Li Guanqi’s dedication to cultivation. No one objected to this praise. After all, it wasn’t just about his talent; everyone acknowledged that Li Guanqi worked harder than anyone else. 1\nSome people were born with talent, and that’s simply how the world worked. But when someone more talented also worked harder, that was truly upsetting.0\nLi Nanting was equally delighted. At night, he had a long conversation with Li Guanqi in his courtyard, offering him one piece of advice.0\n“Don’t rush into the Foundation Building Realm.”0\nLi Nanting said, “For you, Foundation Building is just the beginning, so your overall foundations must be solid! Expand your dantian as much as possible during the Qi Refinement Realm! This will determine how far you can go on the path of immortality!”0\nAfter Li Nanting left, Sword Spirit appeared and remarked, “The little guy’s advice is quite reasonable.”0\nLi Guanqi’s face darkened. “Little guy? My master is over two hundred years old, and you’re calling him a little guy?”0\nSword Spirit simply smiled and said nothing. Instead, she gestured for him to sit down with a solemn expression.0\nPuzzled, Li Guanqi frowned but still complied. Over time, he had come to realize that Sword Spirit was incredibly knowledgeable. No matter what he asked, she always seemed to have an answer. Her harsh training was also always effective, with his rapid breakthroughs being proof of it.0\nAfter a long silence, she finally said, “Do you know how many levels exist in the Qi Refinement Realm?”0\nLi Guanqi blinked in confusion. “The Qi Refinement Realm has ten levels. Isn’t that common knowledge?”0\nHowever, Sword Spirit shook her head.0\n“It’s… not?” Li Guanqi asked.0\nWith a wave of her hand, she set up an invisible barrier around the courtyard. Then, she spoke in a solemn tone. 0\n“That may be what the cultivation world believes. However, the Qi Refinement Realm actually has thirteen levels! The techniques for the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth levels have been lost over time, so everyone only knows ten.”0\nHer words struck Li Guanqi like a thunderbolt, leaving him utterly stunned. 0\n“What? Did I hear that right? Thirteen levels? How is that possible? If that’s true, why does everyone only know about ten? Besides, breaking through the tenth level leads directly to the Foundation Building Realm. What comes after that?”1\nShe simply smiled. She gently tapped the air, sending a wisp of spirit light into Li Guanqi’s mind.0\nIn an instant, complex and obscure sutras flooded his consciousness. 0\nHis eyes gradually widened in shock.0\nHe was looking at the techniques for reaching the thirteenth level of the Qi Refinement Realm.0"

    "content": "Li Guanqi secured the undisputed first place in the first examination that was held after he joined the sect. It prompted Li Nanting to visit him often, worried he might rush his breakthrough to the Foundation Building Realm.0\nSitting in his cultivation room, Li Guanqi reflected on his progress. 0\nSigh… Why would I think of the Foundation Building Realm at this moment? The amount of spirit qi required to break through the tenth stage is too much.0\nAt this moment, his dantian had expanded to the size of a lake. Using a disciple with a Heavenly Spirit Root as a benchmark, Li Guanqi’s dantian could hold several times more vital qi.0\nThis meant that if he wanted to achieve another breakthrough, he had to expand his dantian event further. He would require an amount of spirit qi equivalent to that of a regular late-stage Foundation Building Realm cultivator.0\nAfter completing his previous assignment, he had exchanged all his contribution points for spirit stones. Now, all that was left was the monotonous task of cultivation.0\nTwenty days passed. A fine layer of spirit stone dust covered the cultivation room.0\nSuddenly, the spirit qi in the room began to swirl toward him, forming a whirlpool. As he exhaled, a gentle boom echoed through the room.0\nBoom!0\nOnce again, a layer of black, sticky impurities oozed out of his skin. His eyes sprang open, and he felt more refreshed than he had ever been. 0\nHis five senses also became much sharper than before. His Spirit Platform felt clear, and he sensed that his divine consciousness had significantly strengthened. His dantian even doubled in size.0\nHe continued absorbing the lingering spirit qi in the room, filling his expanded dantian.0\nQi Refinement Realm, eleventh level!0\nSword Spirit appeared quietly. She glanced at him and nodded slightly. His cultivation speed is still far behind the prodigies of the Upper World, but… it’s already quite commendable. Still, the twelfth and thirteenth levels will be much more challenging.2\nAfter a long time, Li Guanqi finally emerged from his cultivation state. He immediately noticed the foul stench emanating from his body and hurried off to boil water for a bath.0\nAs soon as he emerged from the cultivation room, he caught sight of a small figure lying on her stomach atop his roof with a bao in hand.0\nYu Sui’an.0\nWhen Yu Sui’an saw him, she sat up and waved with a grin. “You stink! You’ve already reached the tenth level, so why do you still have so many impurities? You didn’t fall into the toilet, did you?”1\nLi Guanqi’s face darkened. He ignored her.0\nShe’d been following him around ever since his sword coffin broke her rib. Every day, she pestered him and demanded that he buy her baos.0\nIn a flash, he grabbed her from the roof and placed her on the ground. Measuring her height against his hip, he said, “Have you gotten taller?”0\nShe huffed, “Of course! I will be a beautiful tall woman when I’m older! Like this, like this…”0\nAs she spoke, she gestured dramatically around her chest and bottom.0\nLi Guanqi burst into laughter and ruffled her hair. “What do you know, brat? You talk as if you know everything.”0\nYu Sui’an swatted his hand away and rolled her eyes. “I do know everything! Hmmph! I’m going to see Grandfather Li.”0\nThen, she shot off, leaving Li Guanqi to take his bath in peace.0\nAs he soaked in the water, his jade slip flickered gently. He injected a wisp of vital qi into it, and Li Nanting’s voice emerged from it. 0\n—Guanqi, come to the pavilion after you’ve cleaned up.0\nLi Guanqi put down the jade slip, his thoughts turning to a more pressing concern: how to conceal his aura. 0\nIn the cultivation world, it was widely believed that the Qi Refinement Realm only had ten levels. So why had he broken through to the eleventh?0\nHe knew that extraordinary talent could attract problems, especially if someone more powerful than himself took notice of him. He couldn’t tell anyone.0\n***0\nLi Guanqi arrived at the pavilion of Heavenly Lightning Peak’s peak master. He thought something major had happened, so he was surprised to find himself alone.0\nSeeing Li Guanqi, Li Nanting froze. Then, he appeared next to Li Guanqi in a flash. He asked hurriedly, “Have you broken through to the Foundation Building Realm?”0\nBefore Li Guanqi could answer, Li Nanting circled him once, his brows furrowing. “Hmm, it doesn’t seem like it? You’re still at the tenth level… Hmm… Was I mistaken?”1\nLi Guanqi scratched his head awkwardly. “I haven’t reached the Foundation Building Realm yet. Uh… I just felt something different… For some reason, I felt like my dantian expanded a little bit again.”0\nLi Nanting’s face darkened with disbelief. Honestly, he did not know what kind of disciple he had recruited. 0\nOver the past four months, Li Guanqi’s cultivation level had risen quickly. Li Nanting had been watching closely, hoping his disciple would set a new record as the fastest to reach the Foundation Building Realm in the sect’s history.0\nBut if he hadn’t broken through, then what happened?0\nLi Nanting had even heard from Yu Sui’an that she saw Li Guanqi covered in a layer of dirt.0\nHowever, Li Guanqi simply shrugged and said he didn’t know what happened. He was just cultivating, and the impurities appeared.0\nLi Nanting had seen his fair share of strange occurrences, so he chose to drop the matter. As long as Li Guanqi was unharmed, that was all that mattered.0\nLi Guanqi inwardly sighed in relief. If Li Nanting had inspected his dantian, he would have noticed something was very different.0\nLi Nanting changed the subject. “I have some good news for you.”0\n“Oh? What is it?”0\nLi Guanqi took out a bottle of good wine from his storage pouch as he spoke. While it wasn’t as good as immortal wine brewed from the various spirit fruits on the mountain, it had still cost him a hefty sum.0\nLi Guanqi poured the wine for Li Nanting, who smiled in response. 0\n“The Cloud Dream Immortal Palace, which is controlled by us and a few other sects, will open in a month. This time, the Daxia Sword Sect has received five spots. You will receive one,” Li Nanting said, setting down his wine cup.1\nLi Guanqi frowned and asked, “What’s that? Is that a secret realm or something?”0\nLi Nanting paused, then explained, “It’s a very mysterious secret realm. It opens once every hundred years, but its contents are never the same. It’s as if the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace connects to a different realm’s entrance each time. 0\n“These realms often contain great treasures, so your slot is quite valuable. You must make the most of this opportunity.”1\nLi Guanqi nodded. He was very interested in the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace. 0\nThis was also the perfect chance to leave the sect for a while. When he inevitably reached the twelfth or thirteenth level, it would be difficult to explain.0\nAfter that, Li Nanting asked Li Guanqi to pack up and even gave him a magical sword.0\nLi Guanqi stared at its sharp blade, glinting coldly in the light. He was at a loss for words, not knowing how to thank Li Nanting.0\nSeeing his reaction, Li Nanting smiled and waved him off. “I heard from the people at the Artifact Hall that you’ve already taken a dozen pig iron swords from them in the past few months. I can’t use this sword anymore, so you should take it.”1\nLi Guanqi lowered his gaze to the wine bottle. He did not speak for a long time. 0"

    "content": "The next morning, Li Guanqi emerged from his cultivation state as usual. His foundation at the eleventh level had fully stabilized, and the sheer power coursing through him enamored him.0\nHe took out the magical sword he had received yesterday. As he guided his vital qi through his body, he could sense the immense power of this sword compared with the usual pig iron sword. 0\nHe practiced his sword technique dozens of times, exhausting every ounce of strength before finally stopping to rest.0\nThe calluses on his left hand were thicker than those on his right, and the skin between his left thumb and index finger had split so many times that a thick callus had formed.0\nSword Spirit stood nearby, watching him practice with an amused expression and occasionally offering feedback.0\nWhen the sky lightened completely, Li Guanqi packed up and went to Heavenly Sword Peak.0\nThe vast plaza was nearly empty. As he approached, he recognized the people there.0\nLin Dong of Heavenly Earth Peak brightened when he saw Li Guanqi and enthusiastically waved. The person beside him smiled.0\n“I knew I had bet correctly. The last candidate was definitely going to be you.”0\nEven without activating his heart’s eye, Li Guanqi would have recognized this person. It was the King of Bets from Heavenly Metal Peak, Ye Feng. 0\nOver the past few months, Li Guanqi had won at least three hundred spirit stones from his bets with Ye Feng, prompting other disciples to give Ye Feng that nickname.2\nThe third candidate was Zhong Lin, whom Li Guanqi met during his first class at Heavenly Water Peak.0\nThe last person was a strikingly beautiful young woman with a cold demeanor—Ke Qin, a disciple of Heavenly Water Peak from the batch of disciples preceding Li Guanqi and the others. She could even be called a national beauty. 0\nKe Qin was a direct disciple of Lan He and had reached the ninth level of the Qi Refinement Realm, putting her far ahead of Lin Dong and Zhong Lin.0\nLin Dong and Zhong Lin had both reached the peak of the seventh level and seemed on the verge of breaking through to the eighth. On the other hand, Ye Feng‌ had already reached the peak of the ninth level, earning Li Guanqi’s respect.1\nThe leader of the excursion was Shen Lan, the peak master of Heavenly Water Peak. She glanced at Li Guanqi with a flicker of recognition and mused, “You spend all day practicing sword techniques. You’d better not neglect your spells.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded guiltily. He had not attended Heavenly Water Peak’s classes for a long time.0\nShen Lan didn’t press further, and Li Guanqi gave Ke Qin a brief nod in greeting.0\nA bright light appeared in Shen Lan’s hand, followed by a boat the size of a spirit stone materializing in her palm.0\nEveryone watched in shock while Zhong Lin explained to Li Guanqi, “This is called a cloud boat, equivalent to a spirit artifact. We usually take the cloud boat for long journeys.”0\nShen Lan tossed the cloud boat in the air, and it expanded into a ten-zhang-long vessel.0\nTwo folded sails rested at either end of the boat, presumably for adjusting its course.0\nThe group boarded the cloud boat. Under Shen Lan’s control, the boat slowly ascended into the air. They pierced through the clouds, watching the Daxia Sword Sect shrink beneath them.0\nA shimmering azure shield enveloped the boat, then it shot off quickly.0\n“We’re heading into the Zhenyue Mountain’s territory this time,” Shen Lan announced. “While we’re traveling, I’ll tell you about the major factions surrounding our sect.0\n“There are six dominant forces around us—the Azure Dragon Island, Myriad Immortal Sword Sect, Purple Cloud Sword Sect, Seven Strings Sect, Zhenyue Mountain, and ourselves. Within this hundred thousand-zhang radius, these are the only factions that matter. The rest are not worth mentioning.”0\nAfter a pause, Shen Lan continued, “The Daxia Sword Sect, Zhenyue Mountain, and Myriad Immortal Sword Sect are the strongest and the leaders. All six sects rule over the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace together. I assume you all know what makes the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace special.”0\nLi Guanqi felt puzzled. “Elder Shen, if the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace is truly that magical, aren’t you afraid of other people targeting it?”0\nShen Lan smiled and said, “That’s not a concern. The palace has a strange quirk—it only allows disciples at the Qi Refinement Realm to enter, and nothing obtained within the secret realm surpasses the Golden Core Realm.2\n“The secret realm isn’t too useful to people beyond that level. However, it is an excellent training ground for our disciples, and the dangers inside are relatively manageable.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded. No wonder no one fought for the place—it wasn’t as valuable as he had thought.0\nAt that moment, Sword Spirit’s voice rang in his mind. 0\n“Oh? A little Hundred-Connection Realm. Interesting.”0\n“What’s a Hundred-Connection Realm?” Li Guanqi replied internally.0\nSword Spirit lazily said, “It’s the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace you mentioned. Some power from an Upper Realm cultivator remained in this world, forming a secret realm like this one. Secret Realms often naturally attract spatial fragments from across space, forming connections to them.”0\nLi Guanqi frowned. He was still unfamiliar with the concept, but he had a rough understanding now.0\nWhile on the boat, the other disciples walked around to take in the sights, as this was all new to them. In contrast, Li Guanqi sat alone at the end of the boat and started to cultivate.0\nShen Lan nodded lightly with a smile. He may be a prodigy, but his dedication is what truly sets him apart. Li Nanting has recruited a good disciple…0\nThe cloud boat traveled so fast that it covered more than one thousand li in a day. Despite this, they traveled for a full day and night before finally seeing the blurry silhouette of a towering mountain. The mountain was gigantic, its peak piercing through the clouds.2\nMany immortal cranes and other tamed flying beasts flew past them.0\nAn enormous red cloud boat emerged next to theirs. It boasted two sails and moved much faster than their boat, quickly overtaking them.0\nTheir cloud boat started to shake vigorously, and even the light shield trembled. Shen Lan quickly injected more vital force into the ship’s helm and stabilized the ship.0\nLi Guanqi rose slowly and looked at the back of the red cloud boat.0\nA youth with an icy expression glared right at Li Guanqi while he smirked in return. Who is that?0\nAfter a long pause, Li Guanqi turned to Shen Lan and asked softly, “Elder Shen, which faction does that cloud boat belong to? And who’s at the end of that boat?”0\nShen Lan’s face darkened. “Zhao Xuanzhu. He’s an outstanding disciple from the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect’s current cohort of disciples. We’ve never been able to see eye to eye with the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect. If they instigate anything in the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace’s secret realm, you have my permission to beat them up!”0\nEveryone grinned at her words.0\nBuzz!0\nZhenyue Mountain’s protective array opened, allowing the cloud boat to stop on the edge of a platform on the mountain. The cloud boats from the other factions had arrived long before them, so they were the last to arrive.0\nBefore they could disembark, a shrill voice rang out, “Shen Lan! I was just saying—is the Daxia Sword Sect that poor? You lot have been using that same old boat forever! It’s way too slow! Everyone’s been waiting for you!” 0"

    "content": "Shen Lan’s expression turned icy. She reached out and opened her palm.0\n“Spell number two hundred and eighty-two! Thunder Whip!”3\nCrack!0\nA purple whip burst forth, crackling with energy as it lashed across the man’s face.0\nThud!0\nThe force sent him flying several zhang through the air. The impact charred his cheek black.0\nThe man pointed at Shen Lan with a trembling finger, his blood pressure rising.0\nShen Lan put away the Thunder Whip and led her group past him.0\n“You’re a mere administrator of Azure Dragon Island. How dare you speak to me like that? Hmph! Hopefully, this will teach you to think before you open your mouth!”0\nThe man seethed with rage but did not dare retort. Shen Lan’s glare made it clear that if he spoke again, she would strike him again.0\nOnce Shen Lan’s party was far away, the man finally dared to curse, “That bitch! Once you guys enter the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace, try to kill a few of them!”0\nAt the very back of the group, Li Guanqi overheard him and smirked coldly. Hehe, you think you can kill us?0\nBefore long, they reached the meeting point where the disciples of Zhenyue Mountain had been waiting for a long time. The disciples of Zhenyue Mountain wore earth-yellow sect robes.0\nOne of the older elders hurried forward when he saw Shen Lan. “Hahaha! I didn’t expect Elder Shen to be the chaperone for Daxia Sword Sect’s disciples this time. I apologize for the humble welcome… My, my, the Daxia Sword Sect has recruited several excellent disciples this time.”0\nThe elder was very polite to his guests, expressing all the usual niceties of a host. He glanced back and said, “These are our disciples who joined this year. They’re still somewhat lacking compared to your kids.”0\nDespite the modest words, pride flickered in his expression. After all, most of the disciples behind him were at the ninth level of the Qi Refinement Realm, making them outstanding cultivators.0\nShen Lan smiled. “Let’s hope our disciples look out for each other in the Cloud Dream Immortal Palace.”0\nThe elder gave a small smile. “Of course, of course.”0\nWith that, he led the group toward the back of Zhenyue Mountain’s main peak.0\nAs they walked along, the disciples of the few sects started to gather. Li Guanqi spotted a familiar figure in the crowd. 0\nThat guy… Li Guanqi’s expression didn’t change, but inwardly, he tried to recall the name. Luo Hu? So he ended up joining Azure Dragon Island.0\nLi Guanqi shook his head and sighed. It looks like not every sect is like the Daxia Sword Sect. Luo Hu showed terrible character during the enrollment ceremony… but with a double-lineage spirit root, Azure Dragon Island still took him in.1\nStill, Li Guanqi couldn't help but notice another youth—Zhao Xuanzhu. He possessed a certain quality that was difficult to ignore.0\n***0\nBefore long, all six sects had assembled on a massive altar. The Zhenyue Mountain elder from before took center stage.0\n“I trust you’ve all explained the rules to your disciples. Once inside the secret realm, you are responsible for your own lives. Any grudges you bear inside, you leave inside.0\n“Now that everyone is ready, let’s begin.”0\nThe chaperones of the six sects took out special jade pendants and tossed them into the air. The six pendants glowed, and a beautiful, illusory palace appeared in the sky.0\nShen Lan suddenly spoke to Li Guanqi via voice transmission.0\n“If you encounter trouble inside, strike where necessary! Kill if you have to!”0\nShe also transmitted a message to the other disciples. “Once you all get inside, Li Guanqi will be your leader!”0\nHer tone left no room for argument. Lin Dong and Ye Feng remained indifferent, while Ke Qin hesitated briefly before nodding. Only Zhong Lin remained uncertain but said nothing.0\nThe space in front of them distorted, and a spatial crack appeared. The elder boomed, “Remember not to break through to the Foundation Building Realm inside, or you’ll be transported out immediately! Good luck, everyone!”2\nBuzz!0\nWhen the spatial crack stabilized, everyone rushed into the secret realm.0\nShen Lan said gently, “You guys may go in too.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded slightly, then led his team in.0\nPassing through the spatial crack felt like plunging into water. His consciousness flickered.0\nWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!0\nHidden weapons tore through the air!0\nClang clang clang!0\nLi Guanqi suddenly felt the space beneath his feet empty and began to fall. Simultaneously, he drew his sword and skillfully slashed at the hidden weapons flying towards his face.0\n“Everyone, be careful!”0\nWhoosh! Whoosh!0\nThey plunged several zhang before landing hard. Their faces paled.0\nThe instant Li Guanqi touched the ground, he shot forward like a hunting leopard. The group only heard a dull thud as a shallow crater formed where he had stepped.0\nYe Feng used a sprint technique and followed Li Guanqi with a sword in hand.0\nThe remaining three pulled out their weapons and eyed their surroundings cautiously.0\nZhong Lin’s brows furrowed. He made a quick decision. “Go! We’ll head left!”0\n***0\nA young man in purple robes frowned at the scene. He actually deflected all my hidden weapons?0\nHe turned to flee. But the moment he turned, Li Guanqi was already less than twenty zhang away from. At his speed, he would catch up in just a few breaths’ time.0\nWhat the hell? How is he so fast?0\nBehind Li Guanqi, Ye Feng pushed his sprint technique to its limit but still couldn’t catch up. He muttered, “That guy’s physical strength is insane! It’s like he’s practicing Body Tempering cultivation, relying on pure physical strength. And yet, he’s still so fast!”0\nLi Guanqi frowned and extended his divine consciousness to track the other person’s location more easily. The corners of his lips curled up as he muttered, “Seven Strings Sect?”0\nBoom!0\nHe accelerated once more, and in the blink of an eye, there was a several-zhang gap between him and Ye Feng.0\nThey were in a vast forest, and the youth they were chasing had jumped up a tree, leaping from branch to branch. As he did, he took out his jade slip and cried out, “Help! I’ve been discovered!”0\nSuddenly, the youth felt a burning hot breath tickle the back of his neck. He turned around and was met with a creepy sight—a pair of white eyes staring right at him.0\n“Gotcha!”0\nBam!0\nLi Guanqi kicked him hard in the ribs.0\nCrack!0\nHe flew backward like a ragdoll, crashing through an ancient tree before slamming into the ground. Blood spurted from his mouth.0\nThe youth lay on the ground screaming in agony, clutching his ribs with his left hand.0\nYe Feng saw what happened and finally arrived by Li Guanqi’s side.0\n“Tsk. He’s very unlucky to have met you.”0\nThe others arrived soon after.0\nKe Qin frowned at the sight of the youth vomiting blood. Zhong Lin’s expression turned solemn. Based on his aura, he should be at least at the eighth level of the Qi Refinement Realm… yet he was utterly helpless against Li Guanqi.0\nLi Guanqi remained silent as he advanced toward the youth, his expression cold and determined, a sword in his hand.0\nKe Qin hesitated. “Why don’t we just… leave him? He’s already paid the price. The six sects have worked with each other for many years. We can’t just kill him like that.”0\nLi Guanqi furrowed his brows upon hearing her words. They did not know where the other participants were. If they killed this youth, there would be no evidence or external witnesses.0\nSince the youth had attacked them first, Li Guanqi had no intention of letting him go.0\nSuddenly, the fallen youth’s eyes flashed with venom. He hurled a dagger at Ke Qin’s face with one hand. 1\n“Die!!”0\nWhoosh!0\nYe Feng quickly swung his sword to block the dagger.0\n“Careful!” 0"

    "content": "Ke Qin’s mind went blank. She stood frozen, unable to move.0\nPfft!0\nAt the last moment, a hand caught the dagger’s blade right in front of her face.0\nFresh blood trickled from Li Guanqi’s palm. His face remained emotionless as he strode toward Ke Qin. 0\nThen, he flung the dagger aside.0\nThud!0\nThe dagger pierced through the youth’s palm, pinning him to the ground.0\nLi Guanqi’s eyes were fixed on Ke Qin’s empty gaze. Despite her pale complexion, he spoke in a low voice.0\n“This is the only time I’ll let you show mercy, as I can bear the consequences. If this happens again, I’ll leave you behind and let you fend for yourself. Killing is allowed in the secret realm, so do not treat it as a game,” Li Guanqi said. “We only have one life, and I do not want someone with a weak heart holding me back.”0\nPfft!0\nCold light flashed as he swung his sword. The Seven Strings Sect disciple’s head tumbled to the ground.0\nLi Guanqi finished the job with no emotion on his face. “We need to leave quickly. His people will arrive here very soon.”0\nWith that, Li Guanqi took the youth’s storage pouch and identity jade slip.0\nKe Qin trembled all over, her complexion pale and her face stained with several drops of splattered blood.0\nLi Guanqi turned his head and said coldly, “If you don’t come now, you won’t get another chance to follow us again.”0\nKe Qin snapped out of her daze, panic flashing in her eyes. “I… Yes, I’m coming!”0\nThe team of five shot off in another direction. They remained silent until Ye Feng, the bravest of the group, finally spoke.0\n“Have you killed someone before?”0\n“Yes,” Li Guanqi replied calmly.0\nThen, he suddenly changed direction. His eyes sprang open, and he said in a low voice, “Ye Feng, Zhong Lin, go hide five hundred zhang away from here. Do not show yourselves until I strike.”0\nLin Dong frowned. “Is this because the Seven Strings disciples are here? Did you see that on the jade slip?”0\nYe Feng pursed his lips and said, “Of course! That’s what that guy’s jade slip was for! To track their locations!”0\n“Zhong Lin, follow me!”0\nWhoosh!0\nThe both of them hid among the tall wild grass.0\nLi Guanqi turned and glanced at Ke Qin. Her vacant expression was a clear sign that she was still shaken. He sighed to himself. 0\nThey’re all lambs who have been living sheltered lives…0\n“Lin Dong, we’ll head over from the east! There are two of them, so let’s end this quickly!”0\nThe three of them moved eastward. Li Guanqi’s eyes narrowed as his mind raced. Since there is already conflict, we must kill them all.0\nHis grandfather had drilled this into him from a young age. When conflict arises, either stay out of it entirely or resolve it completely. 0\nBack in the village, he had often wondered why his grandfather kept lecturing him about it so much. Now, he finally understood.0\nWhoosh whoosh!0\nTwo disciples in purple robes arrived, their faces darkening the moment they saw their fellow disciple’s headless corpse. “Fuck! Daxia Sword Sect! How dare you kill a Seven Strings Sect disciple?!”0\nThe youth’s voice trembled with fury and grief—only for another voice to coldly answer in his ear.0\n“Why wouldn’t I dare?”0\nClang!0\nLi Guanqi swung his sword, only to be blocked by the other youth, who had just broken through to the tenth level of the Qi Refinement Realm.1\nThe youth’s expression was cold. He had narrow eyes and very light eyebrows, clearly a cunning person. “You guys hadn’t left. I knew it. The Daxia Sword Sect has recruited some vicious disciples indeed.”0\nClang!0\nLi Guanqi slashed his sword down repeatedly with a smirk, his strikes as fierce as a storm. “You talk too much.”1\nClang! Clang Clang!0\nThud!0\nSparks flew as their swords clashed. The enemy was at the tenth level of the Qi Refinement Realm, but Li Guanqi’s powerful vital qi forced him backward with every clash.0\nLi Guanqi’s moves were relentless—swift as the wind, crushingly aggressive. The youth managed to parry each strike, but in the end, Li Guanqi managed to kick him several zhang in the air.0\nBefore the youth could stabilize himself mid-air, Li Guanqi channeled his vital qi into his feet and shot forward like a gust of wind.0\nPfft! The swords collided again. 0\nLi Guanqi thrust once again, and this time, his blade plunged into the youth’s chest. As he did, the youth’s sword stabbed into Li Guanqi’s shoulder.1\nYet Li Guanqi didn’t pause. He turned and joined Lin Dong’s battle despite his fresh wound.0\nLin Dong and Ke Qin had never taken a life before. Despite having the advantage of two against one, they could only manage to keep their opponent trapped.0\nSeeing that Li Guanqi had killed his senior brother, the other enemy panicked. “I’m an inner disciple of the Seven Strings Sect! You guys cannot kill me!”0\nHis desperate words made Lin Dong and Ke Qin hesitate.0\nNo! Li Guanqi immediately rushed over.0\nYe Feng and Zhong Lin also rushed over from behind, but they were powerless to stop what happened next.0\nThe disciple’s fingers tightened around two purple-black pills in his hand—a last ditch effort.0\nIn the face of imminent danger, Li Guanqi threw his sword forward. Lightning vital qi crackled through the air.0\nPfft!0\nThe blade pierced through the disciple’s skull, stopping just a finger’s length away from Ke Qin’s face.0\nArriving from the back, Ye Feng and Zhong Lin grabbed Lin Dong and Ke Qin and sprinted off.0\nJust as they managed to move away, the two pills landed on the ground and burst into roaring flames.0\nLi Guanqi panted as he slowly walked to Ke Qin.0\nThen, he picked her up by the collar and slapped her across the face.0\nYe Feng stayed silent, but Zhong Lin shouted, “Senior Brother Li!”0\nKe Qin’s mind went blank after the slap. She hung her head as her eyes reddened. A hand-shaped mark was apparent on her fair skin.0\n“If you want to die, then go die by yourself! Don’t drag us down with you! You'd be dead already if Lin Dong hadn’t blocked that strike! If you refuse to kill, then just stick out your neck and let them kill you instead!” Li Guanqi shouted.1\nHis chest heaved, and he panted heavily.0\nHe turned away and retrieved his sword. Without another glance at Ke Qin, he tossed the storage pouches from the two corpses to Ye Feng and Lin Dong while handing the earlier one to Zhong Lin.0\nAfter cleaning up the area, Li Guanqi squatted on the ground without looking at Ke Qin, whose shoulders were trembling. “When you enter the world of cultivation, you don’t get to peacefully live on your own.0\n“Either you kill or get killed. If you can’t overcome this mental block, I suggest you cripple your cultivation. You can leave the mountain, marry a man, and raise a child.”0\nHe turned to the others. “Let’s go!”0\nKe Qin slumped on the ground. 0\nShe wanted to scream at him, to let out all the anger choking her throat… but she couldn’t. The words were stuck in her throat, refusing to come out.0\nYe Feng tucked away the storage pouch and got up. “If you’ve chosen the path of cultivation, then don’t be so soft-hearted. We’re all in the same boat. If you keep hesitating like this, we’ll have no choice but to leave you behind.”0\nEven the usually kind and supportive Lin Dong stood up quietly. He did not want to kill either, but he wanted to live.0\nRoar! Roar!0\nSuddenly, beastly cries echoed from all directions. 0\nLi Guanqi motioned for them to lay low. He closed his eyes for a while, then said, “To the north! Let’s go!”0\nThe four of them shot off, ignoring Ke Qin.0\nAfter a moment, the red-eyed Ke Qin slowly picked up her sword.0\nHer gaze hardened, and she followed after the others.1\nAfter two battles, Li Guanqi’s strength and decisiveness had completely convinced them. He had become their true leader, and even Ye Feng inwardly admired him.0\nDamn! He’s a true man! Decisive and ruthless!0"

    "content": "The echoing roars of the demonic beasts filled the air. Li Guanqi quickly gestured for the group to stop. 0\nThey had arrived at the edge of the forest. Lush green plains and a towering mountain stretched out before them.0\nAn almost transparent light membrane appeared in front of Li Guanqi.0\nDisciples from the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect and the Purple Cloud Sect were scattered around the massive mountain, running in all directions.0\nAmong them, he spotted Zhao Xuanzhu holding an extraordinary spirit herb. It resembled a water chestnut with black roots and glowed with a soft pink glow. The other Purple Cloud Sect disciples also carried various rare herbs.0\n“Flower Rain Ghost Root! Violet Mushroom!”0\nLi Guanqi was surprised to see these tier-two herbs, which were so valuable that they were considered treasures of nature.0\nWhat concerned him most were the two gigantic demonic beasts nearby.0\nOne was a Darkness Bat with a wingspan of six zhang, the other a zhang-tall Red-Eyed Demonic Ape. From their size alone, they were clearly at the Foundation Building Realm. Li Guanqi had no intention of engaging them head-on.0\nHowever, he was curious about what that place was.0\nThe two beasts rampaged after the two teams of disciples, their movements shaking the earth beneath them.0\nYe Feng nudged Li Guanqi and whispered, “What do we do now?”0\nLi Guanqi thought for a moment. He was about to speak when Sword Spirit’s voice echoed in his mind. 0\n“There’s something good in a mountain cave one hundred zhang away.”0\nLi Guanqi swallowed his words, then asked internally, “What is it?”0\n“Taiyi Silver!”0\nLi Guanqi’s eyes widened. “Really?”0\n“It’s up to you to believe me.”0\nHis gaze shifted to the gaping cave entrance in the distance. He hesitated. Was it worth the risk of bringing his whole squad?0\nAfter a brief pause, he made his decision. “I want to check out that cave. Are you all in?”0\nZhong Lin rubbed his palms excitedly. “Of course! Those other disciples retrieved some spirit herbs. We’ve got to get some good stuff for ourselves too!”0\nSeeing the group’s enthusiasm, Li Guanqi nodded. “Good. Since the demonic beasts are still occupied, we’ll take this chance to slip inside. The moment things go south, we retreat immediately.”0\nJust then, Li Guanqi turned and spotted Ke Qin standing at the rear with a blank expression. Her eyes were red and swollen. 0\n“I want to go too,” she said. 0\nHer voice was devoid of emotion, as if she were a different person altogether.0\nLi Guanqi looked at her and said gently, “Since you have decided to change, you must take responsibility for that choice. Stop making that face. No one will force you to change if you don’t want to.”0\nKe Qin rubbed her cheeks, her stiff expression softening slightly. 0\nSeeing that she seemed calmer, Li Guanqi said, “Ke Qin, guard the cave entrance. If the two demonic beasts return, inform us immediately. The rest of you, follow me inside.”0\nThe group prepared to leave the cover of the forest and go to the plains.0\nYe Feng turned back to Ke Qin and said, “Don’t take it the wrong way. This is for your own good. We’re trusting you with our lives—don’t let us down.”0\nLi Guanqi commanded, “Now!”0\nWhoosh!0\nThe five of them shot forward in a rhombus-shaped formation, crossing a hundred zhang in mere breaths.0\nThe two demonic beasts remained fixated on the other disciples, now hundreds of zhang away, and failed to notice them. 0\nKe Qin took out a brown guqin[1], then hid behind a boulder protruding from the mouth of the cave.0\nThe rest of them rushed into the cave, which stretched three zhang wide and three zhang high. Damp air clung to their skin, and the ground was very muddy. A rotting stench permeated the space, like the lingering stench of dead fish.0\nLi Guanqi furrowed his brow and extended his divine consciousness, scanning the cave. Everything ahead was laid bare to him. 0\nAs they ventured about one hundred zhang in, his heartbeat quickened, beating faster the further they went. The greater the distance from the entrance, the harder it would be to escape.0\nSlowly, the temperature fell.0\nAt last, a faint glow emerged in the darkness. The passage widened, revealing a space about ten zhang wide. Two massive nests made of dried grass sat within.0\nThe squad quickly ran around, searching for treasures.0\nZhong Lin cried out excitedly, “Damn! There’s a large patch of Blue Valley Grass! This is amazing for refining Foundation Building Realm pills! This is at least a hundred years old!”0\nWithout hesitation, he began harvesting as much as he could.0\n“Where’s the good stuff you were talking about?” Li Guanqi asked Sword Spirit.0\nHe knew her well. With her arrogance, there was no way she’d get excited over those insignificant spirit herbs.0\nHer voice was calm. “Do you see that patch of water in the corner? It’s beneath it.”0\nLi Guanqi quickly ran to the corner and found a cave pool three chi wide. It was only the entrance, and the space beneath was much larger.0\nLi Guanqi shouted, “Call me immediately if anything happens!”0\nTo their shock, he dove into the pool.0\nThe weight of the sword coffin strapped to his back pulled him down swiftly. His heart’s eye was blind in this murky darkness. He extended his divine consciousness but felt his energy draining fast. He had, at most, fifteen minutes.0\nWith guidance from Sword Spirit, he quickly came to a wall in the pool’s depths. He saw a faint silver light on a patch of the stone wall.0\n“What’s that?”0\nSword Spirit said, “Taiyi Silver! It’s a basic material used by Golden Core Realm cultivators to forge magical items. Sometimes, spirit items still also use a little Taiyi Silver.”0\nWithout hesitation, Li Guanqi drew his sword and struck at the silver deposit.0\nBut after striking at it for a long time, it still would not budge.0\nHe was running out of breath, so he took a striking stance. Vital qi surged through him as he brought his sword down with full force.1\nThud!0\nThe whole deposit of Taiyi Silver broke free. He snatched it up just as his divine consciousness began to dim.0\nHe was about to leave when Sword Spirit cried out with surprise, “Huh? Wait! There’s some Black Spirit Clay at the bottom!”0\nJust as Li Guanqi turned back, he heard shouts from above. After a moment of hesitation, he quickly cut the wall behind him, making his sword crack from the impact.0\nA golden chunk of rock fell from the wall.0\nHe quickly grabbed the chunk and swam upward.0\nThen, he heard Ke Qin’s panicked voice through his jade slip. “Leave! Hurry! The two demonic beasts are on their way back! They’re a hundred zhang away!”0\nLi Guanqi’s stomach dropped. It had only been a short while, yet the beasts were already so close.0\nGiven their strength, they would all die unless he broke through to the Foundation Building Realm right now.0\nBut if he did break through, he would be instantly ejected from the secret realm, leaving the squad behind to die.0\nWith their speed, they would have to face the two beasts even if they ran out immediately.0\nWhat should I do… What should I do?!0\nCold sweat sprouted from Li Guanqi’s forehead. 0\n1. A traditional Chinese string instrument. It is a plucked seven-string musical instrument played by scholars. ☜0"

    "content": "Li Guanqi made a snap decision. “Run! Run back!”0\nAt the same time, he pulled out a jade slip. “Ke Qin! Keep us updated on the beasts’ locations! Hurry!”0\nWhoosh!0\nThe group sprinted out of the cave, running as fast as they possibly could.0\nAt the same time, Li Guanqi changed out of his drenched clothing. Ke Qin’s voice occasionally came from the jade slip. 0\n—Eighty zhang!0\nThey were all still a hundred and fifty zhang away from the cave entrance.0\n—Sixty zhang!0\n—Thirty zhang!0\nThe squad was already running as fast as they physically could. Li Guanqi started to scan the space above him with his divine consciousness.0\n —Ten zhang!0\nLi Guanqi could already hear a deep rumble in the ground. They only had to turn one more corner, merely thirty zhang away from the entrance.0\nLi Guanqi suddenly stopped and sent a voice transmission, saying, “Go up the cave’s ceiling!”0\nThe others understood immediately, scaling the cave walls in an instant.0\nZhong Lin slipped, falling one zhang before Li Guanqi grabbed his leg and sent him upward.0\nThe Red-Eyed Demonic Ape and the Darkness Bat arrived at the cave entrance.0\nLi Guanqi looked up, targeting a specific spot before leaping up. He balanced his body weight on all fours, bracing himself against the protruding stalactites to keep himself from slipping.0\nThe group held their breaths as the sound approached. The rumbling grew clearer.0\nGlancing at one another, they all held their breaths. Their hearts pounded, and their every sense sharpened to its peak.0\nFinally, a gigantic beast slowly passed beneath them.0\nFrom above, Li Guanqi could even see dirt on the Red-Eyed Demonic Ape’s fur.0\nSuddenly, the ape lifted its hand to scratch its head. Its fingers came within one chi of Li Guanqi’s foot.0\nThump! Thump! Thump! Thump!0\nLi Guanqi felt like his heart was about to leap out of his body.0\nBut then, the ape turned the corner and left.0\nNext, the pitch-black Darkness Bat walked in. Its wings, covered in a thin membrane, were folded tight, so it relied on its wing’s “elbow” joints to crawl forward.0\nThe bad had poor vision, so it used echolocation to navigate, similar to how cultivators rely on divine consciousness.2\nSlowly, the bat arrived at the corner. And then, it stopped in its tracks.0\nTheir hair stood on end.0\nThe Darkness Bat’s nose wrinkled, and Li Guanqi had a bad feeling. He turned to Zhong Lin and sent a voice transmission. “Did you mask your scent after harvesting the Blue Valley Grass?”0\nZhong Lin’s face went pale.0\n“Run!” Li Guanqi immediately said.0\nThud! Thud! Thud!0\nThe whole group landed on the ground. The bat turned to look at them, then opened its mouth and let out an ear-piercing scream.0\nBlood seeped from their ears, noses, and mouths. Their Spirit Platforms tingled uncomfortably.1\n“Cover your ears! Run!”0\nLi Guanqi roared and dragged Lin Dong and Zhong Lin as he sprinted out of the cave.0\nThe jade slip flickered, and Ke Qin’s voice rang out. 0\n—The Myriad Immortal Sword Sect and Purple Cloud Sect’s members have returned!0\nLi Guanqi’s thoughts raced. They were probably thinking the cave held treasures and were considering making another attempt.0\nBut he had no time to care.0\nBehind them, the two demonic beasts roared loudly, shaking the heavens.0\nThe cave’s walls trembled, and bits of stone tumbled down.0\nThe squad ran at full speed, finally bursting out of the cave. They spotted Ke Qin immediately.0\nHaving no time to brief her, Li Guanqi roared, “Run! Opposite direction!”0\nWithout stopping, they sprinted around the mountain.0\nThe ten disciples from the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect and Purple Sword Sect arrived at the cave entrance, just in time to see them fleeing.0\nZhao Xuanzhu frowned. Why would the Daxia Sword Sect’s disciples be coming out of the cave?0\nRoar!0\nThen, they saw the two demonic beasts who seemed to have lost their minds. 0\nThe moment the beasts spotted the newcomers, they charged at them with even greater fury than before.0\nThe Daxia Sword Sect’s group ran toward the north for a long time. They only stopped once they had run three thousand zhang. 0\nThey collapsed on the ground, having exhausted their vital qi.0\nYe Feng panted as he looked at Li Guanqi, who still seemed unfazed by the run.0\n“You’re a monster!” he muttered.0\nLi Guanqi told them to take the chance to absorb more spirit qi and then said, “I retrieved a couple of things from the bottom of the pool.”0\nThe others had guessed as much but hadn’t had the chance to ask.0\n“What is it? What could be underwater?”0\n“Take it out and show us! What is it?”0\nThud! A large piece of silver crashed to the ground.0\nYe Feng and Zhong Lin’s eyes widened in disbelief.0\nZhong Lin cried out, “Taiyi Silver! And such a large piece too! This is worth at least ten thousand spirit stones!”0\nYe Feng nodded and turned to Li Guanqi. “You said you retrieved two things. What’s the other one?”0\nWhoosh! A golden piece of rock appeared in Li Guanqi’s palm. 0\nZhong Lin did not recognize it, but Ye Feng’s eyes lit up. “Black Spirit Clay! Amazing! Such a large piece is worth at least thirty thousand spirit stones! You’ll be rich!”0\nLi Guanqi did not waste any time on nonsense. He stowed them away and said, “We’ll sell them when we get out and split the profit.”0\nKe Qin, who had been silent, suddenly looked up and whispered, “Do… do I get a share too?”0\nLi Guanqi smiled. “Of course. You did very well. Without you, we wouldn’t have had time to react.”0\nThe others grinned, though they all knew that without Li Guanqi, they would’ve all been eaten. His decisiveness had utterly impressed them.0\nHe rose and looked far away. “Let’s walk and talk. There are buildings up ahead, so let’s check them out. They could be a sect’s secret realm, and we could find far greater treasures than in that cave.”0\nThe others nodded. Their near-death experience had only ignited their spirits.0\nLi Guanqi glanced behind them.0\nThe Myriad Immortal Sword Sect and Purple Cloud Sect…0\n“We haven’t met the people from Zhenyue Mountain or Azure Dragon Island. The Seven Strings Sect should have two disciples left, but they’re not showing up on the jade slip. They must have sensed something.”0\nThey ran forward toward the cluster of buildings. Along the way, they passed two more realms, both sealed by barriers—one an icy world, the other a volcanic one.0\nWith the help of Li Guanqi's divine consciousness, they managed to steer clear of numerous demonic beasts. 0\nAs they moved, a question nagged at him. Why are there so many beasts here? These distinct environments… could they be designed to rear the beasts? Could this place belong to a beast-taming sect?0"

    "chapter_title": "Chapter 47 – Demonic Beast Stampede",
    "content": "The group ran for a long time until they saw the blurry silhouette of the gigantic sect entrance. The sect’s grounds spanned nearly ten thousand zhang, making it as vast as a city.0\nSuddenly, the sound of a commotion reached their ears once more. Li Guanqi held up his hand, instructing them to stop. They hid behind a boulder and peeked out.0\nSix tier-one demonic beasts were attacking a group of disciples clad in earth-colored robes.0\nLi Guanqi frowned. Those were Zhenyue Mountain Sect disciples. They had likely stumbled upon some treasure, only to be discovered by the beasts. Two of the disciples were already injured, and it did not look like they could hold out for much longer.0\nHis mind raced as he weighed the risks and benefits of helping them before finally deciding to help them.0\nWhen Ye Feng noticed Li Guanqi’s reaction, he asked, “Old Li, are we going to help them?”1\nLi Guanqi explained quickly, “We must! And it’s not because of our good relationship with the Zhenyue Mountain Sect. 0\n“Look, we’ve already killed disciples of the Seven Strings Sect, and we also stirred up trouble between us and the Azure Dragon Island earlier. Furthermore, the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect and Purple Cloud Sect have clearly allied. We need allies.”1\nThe group nodded in agreement. Li Guanqi wasn’t acting out of blind righteousness—he had assessed the situation with a clear head.0\nWithout further hesitation, they ran toward the battle a hundred zhang away.0\nLi Guanqi shouted, “Brothers of Zhenyue Mountain Sect! Hold on! We’re coming to help!”0\nThe people from the Zhenyue Mountain Sect lit up when they heard him, but their leader sent them a voice transmission. “We must be cautious!”0\nThree disciples were fending off the beasts while shielding their two injured comrades, trying to create some distance.0\nAs soon as Li Guanqi’s group joined the fray, the battle shifted in their favor. The tier-one beasts they were facing now were nothing compared to the two tier-two beasts they had encountered earlier. The beasts they were facing now were much smaller and weaker.0\nKe Qin’s specialty was dealing the final blow. With each pluck of the strings of her guqin, sound waves infused with spirit power reached the beasts and clouded their minds.0\nBefore long, Li Guanqi and his team had slain four of the Purple Demon Lizards, while the Zhenyue Mountain Sect disciples finished off the remaining two.0\nLi Guanqi instructed Lin Dong to retrieve the demonic beasts’ inner cores. Then, he approached the Zhenyue Mountain Sect disciples.0\nTheir leader was a young man with a toned body and a hardened expression. He wrapped one palm around his other fist in a fist salute and said in a deep voice, ”I am Shen Qi from the Zhenyue Mountain Sect! On behalf of my team, I thank the Daxia Sword Sect for saving us!”0\nHis gratitude was sincere—he understood that if Li Guanqi’s group had harbored ill intentions, they could have easily taken advantage of their weakened state. There would have been no need for deception or schemes.0\nLi Guanqi introduced his team before saying, “There are many beasts in this realm. We should move quickly. Let’s head toward the sect entrance together.”0\nShen Qi nodded, and the two teams set off toward the large mountain.0\nAlong the way, Li Guanqi learned what had happened to them. The disciples of Azure Dragon Island Sect had stolen some eggs from a Purple Demon Lizard’s nest, leading to the Zhenyue Mountain Sect's team being chased instead.0\n“You guys got unlucky. You didn’t get any treasures, yet you had two casualties,” said Li Guanqi with a grin.0\nShen Qi’s expression darkened as he spoke through gritted teeth. “If I catch those Azure Dragon Island Sect bastards, I’ll personally teach them a lesson! Oh, by the way, I heard from them that you guys have beef with the weasels from the Seven Strings Sect. Is that true?”0\nLi Guanqi grinned but did not reply. Ye Feng shrugged and said, “They tried to ambush us the moment we entered the realm, but we killed three of them instead.”1\nShen Qi’s pupils constricted, but he maintained a calm expression.0\nLi Guanqi watched him closely and didn’t stop Ye Feng from speaking freely. He had no intention of hiding the truth—letting the Zhenyue Mountain’s disciples know about their strength served as a warning. It would make them think twice before trying anything.0\nAs they neared the sect that looked like a city, Li Guanqi suddenly stopped.0\nHe squatted and touched the ground with his hand, and then his eyes widened in shock. “Run! Something’s wrong!”0\nThe Daxia Sword Sect’s team broke into a sprint without hesitation.0\nTheir sudden reaction stunned Shen Qi momentarily, but he quickly ran and called for his team to follow. 0\n“Brother Li! What’s going on? Why are we running?” he shouted anxiously, trailing about ten zhang behind Li Guanqi.0\nLi Guanqi replied solemnly, “There’s a large herd of demonic beasts running toward us! There are many! Too many!”0\nThe group ran for a while. When they were about eight hundred zhang away from the tall city walls, they saw a cloud of dust rising just a hundred zhang away.0\nLi Guanqi turned to look and saw hundreds of demonic beasts running toward them. And at the front of the horde, flying above them, was the Darkness Bat from before.0\nThe ground trembled, and the beasts roared.0\nEvery single one of them wished they had two more legs to run faster. 0\nThey were approaching the sect entrance from the south when, suddenly, more people appeared to their left. Another group was also sprinting toward the entrance.0\nLi Guanqi’s eyes widened. There were disciples from every sect—the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect, the Purple Cloud Sect, the Azure Dragon Island Sect, and even the Seven Strings Sect.0\nHis expression turned icy. He commanded, “Hurry! We can’t let them reach the gates first!”0\nThere was nowhere to hide on this vast grassland. Their only chance was to get inside the sect ruins and shut the gates before the beasts arrived.0\nBut the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect and Azure Dragon Island Sect’s disciples had spotted them too.0\nLuo Hu’s expression was even colder. “Senior Brother! Hurry! We must enter first!”0\nBoth teams picked up speed, racing towards the gates.0\nLi Guanqi’s heart sank as he gauged their speed. If he did not think of a solution, the other sects reach the gates first and shut them out, leaving them to die.0\nLi Guanqi turned to look at Shen Qi. “I’m going ahead to prevent them from shutting the city gates after they enter. You guys must hurry!”0\nBefore Shen Qi could respond, Li Guanqi’s muscles tensed—and in the next instant, he shot forward like an arrow, leaving a deep crater where his feet had been. He was even faster than a cheetah.0\nYe Feng pursed his lips. The others might not have known how heavy the sword box strapped to Li Guanqi’s back was, but Ye Feng knew it was five hundred jin. How was he still so fast?0\nLi Guanqi ran as fast as he could. The wind howled in his ears as he charged at the nearest Azure Dragon Island Sect disciple, sword in hand.0\nWhen Luo Hu saw Li Guanqi charging at them, his eyes flashed viciously. He still remembered his humiliating experience at the Daxia Sword Sect. Thankfully, he had managed to join the Azure Dragon Island Sect afterward.0\nLuo Hu said coldly, “Dear Senior Brothers, it seems the blind boy from the Daxia Sword Sect is trying to stop us!”0\nThe eyes of the two remaining disciples from the Seven Strings Sect flashed with killing intent.0\n“Then we must kill him first!”0\n 0\n 0"

    "content": "The disciples of the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect and Purple Cloud Sect sprinted into the sect grounds.0\nRumble!0\nLi Guanqi’s eyebrows shot up in alarm as the massive city gates began to close. It was just as he had feared.0\nThe Azure Dragon Island and Seven Strings Sect’s teams were closing in on him. Before the Seven Strings Sect’s disciples could reach him, dozens of hidden weapons shot straight at him.0\nWhoosh! Whoosh!0\nLi Guanqi waved his sword in all directions, deflecting the hidden weapons with pinpoint accuracy.0\nThe ten-zhang distance between them vanished in an instant. Seven youths surrounded Li Guanqi. However, Li Guanqi held his ground. He had reached the eleventh level of the Qi Refinement Realm.1\nWith his impressive physique and precise swordsmanship, he was able to single-handedly hold off the group.0\nThe leader of the Azure Dragon Island Sect’s team, a youth at the tenth level of the Qi Refinement Realm, glanced back at the rapidly closing gates. A mere ten zhang gap remained.0\nHe shouted hurriedly, “Retreat! Retreat! Hurry! The doors are closing!”0\nAll seven fighters immediately disengaged and withdrew several zhang away, flinging a barrage of hidden weapons and explosive grenades toward Li Guanqi as they fled.0\nThe exploding grenades and weapons hiding amongst the flames forced Li Guanqi to back away. Seeing that the gates were about to close, he ran and roared, “Myriad Immortal Sword Sect! Purple Cloud Sect! If you dare close that door, I will make you pay!”0\nBoom!0\nWhen the teams of Azure Dragon Island and the Purple Cloud Sect had entered, the door closed with a loud boom.0\nLi Guanqi clenched his fists, cursing at them. The stampede of demonic beasts was now less than a hundred zhang behind his team.0\nSuddenly, Sword Spirit’s voice echoed in his mind.0\n“Head east! There’s a protruding boulder a hundred and fifty zhang away. There should be a secret tunnel there!”0\nLi Guanqi led the team in that direction without hesitation. 0\nThe Daxia Sword Sect disciples followed without question. They firmly believed that Li Guanqi wouldn’t lead them into danger.0\nShen Qi of Zhenyue Mountain Sect hesitated momentarily before running after them. “I hope I can trust you!”0\nLi Guanqi sprinted like a madman, scanning the tall mountain wall with his divine consciousness. To their left, the cries of various demonic beasts grew closer and closer. 0\nThe beasts were only ten zhang away.0\n“Found it!”0\nLi Guanqi slung the sword box off his back and hurled it at a boulder protruding from the wall.0\nCrack! Crack!0\nFissures spread up the rock face, opening a narrow, three-chi-wide hole. It was just large enough for them to squeeze through by crawling.0\nLi Guanqi raised his sword box like a shield in his left hand and gripped his sword in his right. “Get in! Quick!”0\nKe Qin and the others quickly crawled through the hole. Ye Feng stood next to Li Guanqi and roared, “You guys hurry up and get inside! Old Li and I will cover for you!”0\nYe Feng was the second strongest among them, so no one objected. Shen Qi stayed back as well.0\nBut just as the two injured disciples from Zhenyue Mountain Sect crawled into the hole, the beasts arrived.0\nTwo beasts that resembled fierce tigers leaped into the air and pounced on Li Guanqi and the others.0\nLi Guanqi dug his feet into the ground, raised his sword box, and flung it at one of the beasts. The impact sent it flying. Immediately after, he slashed at the other in one fluid motion, his blade flashing like lightning.0\nHis sword cut through its belly. Blood sprayed everywhere.0\nYe Feng darted around a White Demonic Bird, then struck it with his sword covered with Sharpness Intention made of golden spirit power.0\nA large silver shield appeared in Shen Qi’s hand, which he used to shield their flank. 0\n“Come at me!” Shen Qi roared, and a layer of earth-yellow spirit power covered the silver shield.0\nA mountain rhinoceros crashed hard into the shield, 0\nThe impact only lasted one second, but it was enough to break Shen Qi’s right arm and send him flying.0\nLi Guanqi turned and slung the sword onto his back. He shoved Shen Qi toward the tunnel’s entrance with his shoulder. He stabbed the shield into the ground with one hand, anticipating the rhinoceros to charge at the shield again. 0\nAs expected, the rhinoceros charged forward again, so Li Guanqi pulled the shield up to fling the rhinoceros into the air.0\n“Go!! Ye Feng! Get inside!”0\nLi Guanqi stood three steps from the entrance with sword and shield in hand.0\nYe Feng did not even turn his head as he shouted, “You too!”0\nThen, he quickly crawled through the hole.0\nThe carcasses of several demonic beasts blocked the entrance, buying Li Guanqi precious time. 0\nHe backed toward the tunnel with the shield in one hand and slipped inside. 0\nWith a single thought, he stored the sword in his storage punch, then slammed his palm against the stone wall.0\nBoom!0\nRocks tumbled down, sealing the entrance.0\nLi Guanqi lay in the tunnel, panting heavily from the effort. He took out two spirit stones to replenish his vital qi. The prolonged chase and intense battle had drained nearly eighty percent of the vital qi in his dantian.0\nThankfully, after Sword Spirit modified his qi absorption technique, his absorption speed became terrifyingly fast. In just a few breaths, he had recovered ten percent of it.0\nBut something felt off. The tunnel was eerily silent. Pitch-black. He couldn’t see his own hand in front of his face.0\n“Ye Feng? Lin Dong!”0\nHe called out twice, but no one replied.0\nLi Guanqi’s heart sank. He quickly finished absorbing the spirit stones in his hand, then took out more and continued.0\nHe finally spotted a faint light after walking tens of zhang through the darkness. He headed toward it, emerging into a vast, empty hall.0\nNo one else was there.0\n“Sword Spirit, what’s going on?”0\nSword Spirit replied impatiently, “Isn’t it obvious? There’s a randomized transport array at the tunnel’s entrance. Many sects build their secret tunnels this way to prevent ambushes from within.”0\nLi Guanqi nodded and sighed in relief. An intense battle would have been unavoidable if they had encountered the other four sects.0\nHe had to be careful since he had not completely recovered his strength yet. Indeed… Humans are selfish creatures!0\nAzure Dragon Island Sect… Myriad Immortal Sword Sect…0\n“Sword Spirit, I can feel the bottleneck at the twelfth level of the Qi Refinement Realm loosening.”0\nSword Spirit offered no praise.0\nLi Guanqi rubbed his nose awkwardly, chose a direction at random, and began walking.0\nThe sect grounds were constructed entirely of stone, but they felt dilapidated. The entire sect ground was built of stone, but the place was in ruins—not from age, but from indiscriminate destruction.0\nSoon, he found a few secret rooms with tightly shut stone doors. He pushed one open with great effort.0\nWhoosh!0\nA gentle breeze blew past, and the various weapons stored in the room instantly crumbled to dust. Li Guanqi was disappointed. He had hoped to find magical treasures or weapons.0\nHe pushed another stone door open. It was empty, save for a few damaged collars. This reinforced his suspicions that this had once been a beast-taming sect.0\nWhen he pushed the last stone door open, his heart leaped with joy. Neatly arranged jade bottles lined a shelf, and two perfectly preserved jade boxes sat in the room’s deepest part.0\nMeanwhile, the disciples of the Zhenyue Mountain Sect and Daxia Sword Sect were locked in an intense battle elsewhere.0"

    "content": "Li Guanqi rifled through the items on the shelf, only to find the jade bottles empty. On the other hand, the jade boxes held a Foundation Building Pill, emanating a rich, potent fragrance.0\nLi Guanqi excitedly stored the pills and empty jade bottles, then turned and left. I can’t let them go to waste. 0\nHmm… Where are those weasels? How dare they shut us out of the grounds, leaving us to die? I’ll make sure they pay for this…0\nAfter emerging from the first hall, he surveyed the ruined sect grounds. The once-grand buildings were large and tall, though they had fallen into disrepair. Crumbling walls stood everywhere, and deep trenches that seemed bottomless marred the floor. Unfamiliar with the layout, he wandered aimlessly.0\nSuddenly, he noticed the tattered hem of a robe peeking out from behind a wall. As he approached, he realized it was draped over a skeleton. 0\nThe skeleton’s ribs had been shattered, suggesting a violent death. The robe’s intricate design suggested it belonged to a high-ranking Daoist priest, likely someone with a high cultivation level.0\nHowever, the robe had long since lost its magical properties. When Li Guanqi gently pinched the fabric, it crumbled into dust.0\nHis attention was drawn to a purple jade pendant lying nearby. It was remarkably well-preserved and engraved with the character “宗” (Sect).0\nLi Guanqi’s heart skipped a beat. Could this person have been the sect leader?0\nHe pulled the robes covering the skeleton off and found a purple jade ring on one of the skeleton’s fingers.0\nLi Guanqi quickly took it off and dusted it on his clothes.0\nThen, he placed his palms together in a prayer pose and bowed. 0\n“Don’t blame me for this. You’re already dead—if I leave it here, it’ll just go to waste. Since I found it, it means karmic ties brought us together. As such, I’m not robbing you. I’m sure you’d agree.”0\nThankfully, that person had been dead for countless years. Otherwise, he would’ve surely scolded Li Guanqi for his shamelessness.2\nLi Guanqi quickly used his divine consciousness to break the weak seal on the ring.0\nTo his astonishment, the ring’s storage space was enormous. The space inside stretched a radius of a hundred zhang, making it ten times as big as his current storage pouch.0\nThere were even many spirit stones inside. With a rough estimate, there were almost a hundred and ten mid-tier spirit stones.0\nLi Guanqi grinned. He had not expected this.0\nThen, he found a special jade slip inside, so he took it out and inspected it. 0\nPeak Black-tier sprint technique, Lightning Flash!0\nLi Guanqi pursed his lips into a wistful smile, then used his divine consciousness to unlock the jade slip.0\nA flood of gray text filled his mind, detailing a complex sutra and the spirit qi induction method.0\nHe attempted to follow one of the sutras inside, which was for a sprint technique. Though the flow of his vital qi felt clumsy, he managed to grasp the basic concept.0\nLooting the dead this early in my cultivation journey? No wonder they say the cultivation world has the most robbers.0\nHe slipped the ring onto his finger and rose to his feet.0\nSuddenly, the jade pendant in his hand lit up with a soft glow, pointing toward a specific direction. Li Guanqi followed immediately.0\nWith the jade pendant’s guidance, he went through the sect’s main hall to the back of the mountain.0\nAlong the way, he encountered nothing of interest, save for two meditation cushions carved from white jade.0\nVery soon, he arrived at the back of the sect’s mountain. This area of the sect grounds was usually a restricted area.0\nThe deeper he ventured, the more eerie the surroundings became, with remnants of a fierce battle everywhere. In the end, he came to a relatively well-preserved mansion. He looked up at the plaque above the door. 0\nSect Master’s Mansion.0\nA thin barrier made of light blocked Li Guanqi, but when he injected a sliver of vital qi into the jade pendant, a gap opened, allowing him to enter.0\nInside, the light on the pendant guided him to a transport array in a bedroom. He looked at the indent on the array and then placed the pendant inside.0\nBuzz!0\nThe array glowed, but nothing happened. His gaze flicked across the array, spotting several more indentations. He understood immediately.0\nHe placed sixteen more spirit stones in the array. It lit up again, but nothing else happened.0\nDoes this stupid array want mid-tier spirit stones instead?!0\nCrackle! Crackle!0\nIn the blink of an eye, Li Guanqi vanished.0\nCrackle! Crackle!0\nLi Guanqi’s eyes sprang open. A stinging pain all over his body had woken him up. To his surprise, he was standing on an ancient altar.0\nLightning crackled all around him, and some tendrils even landed on him. He trembled uncontrollably.0\nLooking up, he saw a vast pool of lightning suspended above the altar. At its center, there was an object seemingly absorbing the lightning’s power.0\nThen, Sword Spirit gradually appeared next to him. It took a lot of energy for her to manifest, so she never did so without good reason.0\nLi Guanqi looked at her and said, “What’s that?”0\nHer beautiful eyes were locked onto the object at the lightning pool’s center. Her voice was soft, almost disbelieving. “Why would this appear in the Human Realm?”0\nLi Guanqi frowned. “What is it?”0\nShe turned to look at Li Guanqi, her eyes filled with various emotions. Once again, Sword Spirit began to question why Su Xuan had entrusted her to Li Guanqi.0\n“You’re incredibly lucky,” she murmured. “If you get that thing, it will be of great use to you in the future. However, you’ll have to rely on yourself to get it. I’d suggest taking the entire altar with you.”0\nShe disappeared, leaving behind the confused Li Guanqi. He lamented, “Could you at least tell me what it is?! The lightning power here is too intense! If I walk any closer, it will burn me to a crisp!”0\nDespite his complaints, curiosity burned within him. Whatever that object was, it was valuable enough for Sword Spirit to show herself.0\n“Hoo… Let’s do it!”0\nLi Guanqi took a deep breath. His eyes were filled with solemn determination.0\nThe Nine Spinning Lightning Sutra started to flow within his body.0\nImmediately, the lightning pool reacted, almost as if perceiving him as a threat. Bolts of lightning surged toward him.0\nBoom!0\nExplosions echoed across space.0\nOnly ten zhang separated him from the pool, but after just three steps, his pace slowed.0\nAt this point, the powerful lightning power had engulfed nearly his entire body.0\nHe groaned with pain. “Ahh! Fuck!”0\nThe bolts seared his skin, charring it black. This was even worse than his first medicinal bath.0\nHmmph!0\nThen, an idea struck him. 0\nHe gripped his sword box in one hand and the shield from earlier in the other.0\nBracing himself, he leaped.0\nHe covered the remaining distance in just one leap. Thunder rumbled around him and several lightning bolts pierced through his magical shield.0\nLi Guanqi reached out and grabbed the human-head-sized item at the center of the lightning pool, then quickly stored it with his storage ring.0\nThe moment the lightning disappeared, Li Guanqi collapsed on the altar. His entire body was charred, his hair singed, and his clothes reduced to tatters. Blood seeped from the wounds where the lightning had struck.1\nCountless lightning wisps were still weaving through his meridians.0\nLi Guanqi lay stiffly on the altar in agony, unable to move.0"

    "content": "Li Guanqi lay stiffly on the altar, his entire body numb and wracked with pain.0\nSweat trickled down his forehead, a green vein pulsating. His fingers twisted and his face contorted in agony. He felt as if a knife were slicing through his insides.0\nDespite the agony, he forced himself to circulate the Nine Spinning Lightning Sutra, gradually drawing the tiny arcs of lightning in his body into his dantian.0\nThe searing pain was so intense that he almost wished for death, but he clenched his jaw and roared, “This lightning is nothing! I will refine it!”0\nBoom!0\nThe tiny arcs of electricity were refined into extra-intense wisps of vital qi.0\nBoom!0\nThere was a light explosion, then Li Guanqi collapsed weakly. He muttered with a grin on his face, “Twelfth level!”0\nHis dantian had expanded by thirty percent, now resembling a vast lake.0\nAfter a long moment, he finally rose to his feet and inspected his magical shield. It was riddled with holes, and the lightning had extinguished its spirit light, rendering it useless.0\nOnly then did he remember to check the item he had placed in his storage ring.0\nWhat’s this?0\nA purple egg the size of a human head floated quietly in his storage ring. It was covered in purple scales, like a pinecone.0\nLi Guanqi frowned and asked, “Sword Spirit, what’s this?”0\nSword Spirit replied, “It’s a Lightning Dragon egg! I don’t know why something like that would appear in the Human World…”0\n“A dragon egg?!” Li Guanqi said, his hands trembling with excitement.0\nBreaking through to the twelfth level paled in comparison to the exhilaration of this discovery. He pictured himself standing on the head of a colossal dragon, looking down at the world.0\nSword Spirit swiftly tempered his dreams. “You should be thinking about how to hatch it first. Its life force is weak, so I think it’ll take a long time to incubate. But if you’re lucky enough to hatch it and form a master-servant agreement, it’ll be a tremendous asset.”0\nIgnoring his injuries, Li Guanqi immediately stored the entire altar in his ring. He set the dragon egg atop it, and the altar crackled with endless lightning once again.0\nSword Spirit remarked, “This thing is going to drain your resources. Upper-tier spirit stones can sustain it for about a year. If you’re using low-tier spirit stones, you’ll need to spend about three thousand spirit stones a month. Be mentally prepared.”0\nLi Guanqi groaned. “Three thousand spirit stones per month?! Damn it… I don’t even use that many for my cultivation!”2\nSince there was nothing else in this secret room, Li Guanqi exited via the transport array. Before departing, he carefully collected the spirit stones from the array—every bit of wealth mattered.0\n“I don’t care! Even if this dragon eats spirit stones, I’m going to hatch it! Tsk! I’ll be a dragon swordsman! It’ll be so cool!”0\nSuddenly, the jade slip hanging on his waist flickered urgently. Li Guanqi turned slightly pale as he picked it up and injected vital qi into it.0\n—Old Li, save us! We found two black-tier cultivation techniques, but the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect and the other teams are after us! Ke Qin’s been wounded, and they’re closing in!0\n“Run as far as you can! I’m coming!” Aware of the message’s urgency, Li Guanqi immediately set off. 0\nBoom!0\nThe bricks beneath his feet exploded as he shot off in their direction.0\n***0\nOn a vast, open platform, six figures stood surrounded by disciples from the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect, Purple Cloud Sect, and Azure Dragon Island Sect.0\nBlades clashed, cold lights flashing through the air.0\n“Are you really planning to kill us all?! Aren’t you afraid of retaliation from the Zhenyue Mountain Sect and Daxia Sword Sect?!”0\nShen Qi had a broken right arm, leaving him to fight for his life with only his left arm and a sword. His body bore numerous cuts from blades, and his eyes were bloodshot.0\nThey had discovered a secret room with an array earlier, only to be ambushed by the Purple Cloud and Azure Dragon Island Sects. The two severely wounded disciples from the Zhenyue Mountain Sect had died instantly. The remaining three had barely escaped with the Daxia Sword Sect’s help.0\nHowever, the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect’s team had expected this and blocked their path. Now, they were trapped.0\nClad in blue robes, Luo Hu vigorously swung his sword while sneering. “If you all die here, who would ever know we were the ones who killed you? Just like the trash from the Seven Strings Sect!”0\nYe Feng was fighting three people by himself, his body covered in blood and his expression ice-cold. 0\nLuo Hu had killed Ke Qin, shooting an arrow through her heart. He hadn’t been able to save her in time.4\nZhong Lin and Lin Dong stood back to back, silently maintaining a defensive formation.0\nZhao Xuanzhu of the Myriad Immortal Sword Sect waved and tossed out a magical ribbon. The silk ribbon extended until it wrapped around Shen Qi and Ye Feng. “Now! Kill them!”0\nSeveral swords lunged for the trapped duo.0\nJust then, a furious roar echoed across the battlefield.0\n“How dare you!”0\nThe disciples of the three factions froze.0\nA lone figure stood atop a boulder, twenty zhang away.0\n“Attack now! He’s here!”0\nLi Guanqi had arrived. They still remembered how he had single-handedly fought off seven people. Moreover, everyone present could sense that his aura was much stronger than before.0\nSeveral swords shot at the ribbon.0\nThe boulder beneath Li Guanqi’s feet exploded, and the faint rumbling of thunder echoed in the air.0\nThe other disciples tried to cut the ribbon off, but it was futile. All they could do was try to stop the blades.0\nHowever, four blades still managed to pierce between the strips of ribbon.0\nShen Qi twisted his body to shield Ye Feng, turning his back toward the swords.0\nThree swords pierced Shen Qi, one barely missing his heart and stabbing into his shoulder instead.0\nWhoosh!0\nLi Guanqi’s voice rang in Luo Hu’s ear, filled with killing intent. 0\n“As promised, I will take my revenge.”0\nLuo Hu’s pupils dilated in fear. A shiver ran down his spine.0\nSwish!0\nA severed head soared into the air. Blood sprayed three chi away.0\nAnd then came a massacre.0\nLi Guanqi’s figure flickered through the battlefield, each swing of his sword claiming a life. His sword glinted again and again.0\nTen breaths later, only one enemy remained.0\nZhao Xuanzhu.0\nPinned against the stone wall, Li Guanqi’s hand gripped his throat like an iron vice.0\nThe color drained from Zhao Xuanzhu’s face as he struggled, his vital qi surging desperately.0\nBut he couldn’t break free.0\nHis face had turned purple from suffocation, his eyes wide with terror.0\nZhao Xuanzhu looked down and met Li Guanqi’s gaze through his blurring vision—pure white eyes burning with boundless fury. He was supposed to be blind, but the rage in his eyes was unmistakable.0\nLi Guanqi twisted his blood-spattered face into a snarl. “Are you afraid?”0\nLittle by little, he pressed his sword toward Zhao Xuanzhu’s chest, eventually piercing his skin.0\nZhao Xuanzhu's eyes widened in terror and excruciating pain. His trembling pupils dilated.0\nZhao Xuanzhu’s mouth opened in a silent plea. His tongue lolled, saliva dripping onto Li Guanqi’s hand. He begged for mercy with his eyes, unable to utter a single word.0\nLi Guanqi’s voice was a low, chilling murmur. 0\n“You could’ve lived a good life. But no… you just had to provoke me. You had to kill a Daxia Sword Sect disciple.0\n“You… deserve to die.”0\nWith a final thrust, his blade pierced through Zhao Xuanzhu’s heart. The friction against his ribs made an eerie screech. 0\nLi Guanqi drove the sword through Zhao Xuanzhu’s body, pinning him to the stone wall like a grotesque ornament.0\nZhao Xuanzhu’s eyes reflected his final moment of terror as the blade pierced his heart with excruciating slowness.0\nLi Guanqi stood panting, his chest heaving. 0\nFinally, he rushed to the others to check on the severely injured Shen Qi.0\nBlood flowed from Shen Qi’s mouth as he stuttered in broken sentences. 0\n“I blocked it… Consider this… repaying the debt… I owed you…”0\n“Don’t talk nonsense! You’re not dead yet!” Li Guanqi snapped, furrowing his brow. “Someone, give him a healing pill!”0\nYe Feng immediately took out a golden vial from his storage pouch. He shook out a pill and stuffed it into Shen Qi’s mouth. Color quickly returned to Shen Qi’s face, and the bleeding stopped. His breath stabilized significantly.0\nShen Qi lay on the ground with a pale face and said, “Damn! I owe you my life!”0\nLi Guanqi’s expression darkened. “Ke Qin…”0\nZhong Lin murmured, his voice hollow. “She… she died saving me.”2\nLi Guanqi fell silent.0\nBuzz!0\nThe heavens and earth trembled, and a crack appeared in the air.0\n“We need to leave,” Li Guanqi said gently. “Remember—we don’t know how they died. We never met the other teams, and we stayed by ourselves the entire time.”0\nThe Zhenyue Mountain Sect disciples nodded solemnly, understanding the reason behind Li Guanqi’s words. The Daxia Sword Sect had saved them all, and Li Guanqi in particular saved their lives twice.0\nOther than their two teams, everyone else had died. No one could know what had happened.0\n“You guys take Shen Qi out first, as his injuries must be treated immediately. We’ll exit later.”1"
